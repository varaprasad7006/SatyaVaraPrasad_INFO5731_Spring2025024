However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from clich\\u00e9, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good.\",\n          \"Quite simply \\\"Dark Knight\\\" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a \\\"proper\\\" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).\\n\\nBatman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't \\\"just\\\" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of \\\"dark\\\" and of perception of \\\"society.\\\" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.\\n\\nSecondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these \\\"abilities\\\" about him which are soooo unrealistic.\\n\\nSo, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.\\n\\nThe action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!\\n\\nI won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!\\n\\nEverything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.\\n\\nIt's cool It's original It's awesome\\n\\nI can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him\",\n          \"I really wanted to see this in the theater;however, I never did last summer. Instead I waited till it came on cable, and after watching it; I really didn't miss anything by not going to the theater. I was rather disappointed because I was expecting this to be as good as Spiderman, but I don't think it was. I thought it was rather slow moving with sparse action scenes. I mean Batman on the chopper really wasn't that much action. A lot of films have had better car chasing scenes then that.\\n\\nAnd I really didn't think Heath Ledger was anything special in this. His role was just a lot of hype. Probably the best role was by Aaron Eckhart and the special effects with his face at the end.\\n\\nI also have to comment on Christian Bale's Batman voice. What was he trying to do?? He sounded like a chronic smoker with emphysema.\\n\\nFINAL VERDICT: It was good, just not as good as advertised. I don't get why so many people thought it was the best comic book movie to be made.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from clich\\u00e9, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good.\",\n          \"Quite simply \\\"Dark Knight\\\" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a \\\"proper\\\" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).\\n\\nBatman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't \\\"just\\\" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of \\\"dark\\\" and of perception of \\\"society.\\\" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.\\n\\nSecondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these \\\"abilities\\\" about him which are soooo unrealistic.\\n\\nSo, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.\\n\\nThe action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!\\n\\nI won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!\\n\\nEverything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.\\n\\nIt's cool It's original It's awesome\\n\\nI can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him\",\n          \"I really wanted to see this in the theater;however, I never did last summer. Instead I waited till it came on cable, and after watching it; I really didn't miss anything by not going to the theater. I was rather disappointed because I was expecting this to be as good as Spiderman, but I don't think it was. I thought it was rather slow moving with sparse action scenes. I mean Batman on the chopper really wasn't that much action. A lot of films have had better car chasing scenes then that.\\n\\nAnd I really didn't think Heath Ledger was anything special in this. His role was just a lot of hype. Probably the best role was by Aaron Eckhart and the special effects with his face at the end.\\n\\nI also have to comment on Christian Bale's Batman voice. What was he trying to do?? He sounded like a chronic smoker with emphysema.\\n\\nFINAL VERDICT: It was good, just not as good as advertised. I don't get why so many people thought it was the best comic book movie to be made.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from clich\\u00e9, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good.\",\n          \"Quite simply \\\"Dark Knight\\\" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a \\\"proper\\\" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).\\n\\nBatman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't \\\"just\\\" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of \\\"dark\\\" and of perception of \\\"society.\\\" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.\\n\\nSecondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these \\\"abilities\\\" about him which are soooo unrealistic.\\n\\nSo, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.\\n\\nThe action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!\\n\\nI won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!\\n\\nEverything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.\\n\\nIt's cool It's original It's awesome\\n\\nI can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him\",\n          \"I really wanted to see this in the theater;however, I never did last summer. Instead I waited till it came on cable, and after watching it; I really didn't miss anything by not going to the theater. I was rather disappointed because I was expecting this to be as good as Spiderman, but I don't think it was. I thought it was rather slow moving with sparse action scenes. I mean Batman on the chopper really wasn't that much action. A lot of films have had better car chasing scenes then that.\\n\\nAnd I really didn't think Heath Ledger was anything special in this. His role was just a lot of hype. Probably the best role was by Aaron Eckhart and the special effects with his face at the end.\\n\\nI also have to comment on Christian Bale's Batman voice. What was he trying to do?? He sounded like a chronic smoker with emphysema.\\n\\nFINAL VERDICT: It was good, just not as good as advertised. I don't get why so many people thought it was the best comic book movie to be made.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

gave birth to the Dark Knight himself the psychotic emulators that Bruce unwittingly coded the constant struggle within to maintain a strict moral code  not to lose himself completely to the darkness he shrouds himself in out of necessity all these elements add to a dark brooding and violent mythology that Nolan manages to capture perfectly without ever giving in to the gratuitous\\n\\nWhile the film is gloriously overthetop which is of course fitting for a comic book universe Nolan manages to ground the larger than life characters and story arcs just enough to add a chill and striking reality to them Heath Ledgers performance as The Joker is especially stunning\\n\\nA perfect example of violence both the physical now and the mental histories and tragedy handled with real care and attention TDK stands as testament not only as a marker for other comic book adaptations but as an expert example of how to do darkness without dealing in the absolutes that shallow the usual attempts\\n\\nA chaotic and brilliant masterpiece\",\n          \"Batman Christian Bale joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon Gary Oldman and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent Aaron Eckhart who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes Maggie Gyllenhaal to fight the organized crime in Gothan City However chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker Heath Ledger that brings a wave of violence and murders The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City\\n\\nThe Dark Knight is a great surprise for a blockbuster with a solid and deep story great direction performances special effects and makeup The adventure is also dramatic with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics morality human nature hope and other important themes The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in TBag from Prison Break and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death In the end The Dark Knight is a great movie the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008 but the IMDb User Rating Top 250 4 is absolutely overrated ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDbs Rating but sometimes the truth is not good enough My vote is nine\\n\\nTitle Brazil O Cavaleiro das Trevas The Dark Knight\",\n          \"Watching The Dark Knight on a big screen is an experience comparable to few other pleasures one can think of immediately I honestly cant remember the last time I felt this satisfied coming out of a film Whats genius about director Christopher Nolans latest Batman installment is that its not only a spectacular comicbook movie but also one with an intellectual heart Its not all chases and explosions and action scenes  although theres lots of that  its also a really smart film about characters with edge and a plot that actually seems to make sense\\n\\nChristian Bale slips into the bat suit once again to play the Caped Crusader who thinks of hanging up his boots when he becomes impressed with District Attorney Harvey Dents crimefighting resolve But when clownfaced psychopath The Joker shows up Batman realises retirement is a long time away\\n\\nIn addition to new characters like Harvey Dent played superbly by Aaron Eckhart by the way all significant characters from Nolans previous film Batman Begins return for this new adventure Police lieutenant Jim Gordon played by Gary Oldman Bruce Waynes faithful butler Alfred played by Michael Caine Waynes goto guy for fancy gizmos Lucius Fox played by Morgan Freeman and assistant DA and Waynes love interest Rachel Dawes played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal are all back and have respectable roles to play here but The Dark Knight is ultimately about Batman and The Joker Its a much darker film than any of the previous Batman movies and it goes into directions that few comicbook films have taken before Much of that edginess comes from The Joker and his sinister plans Not merely content at killing his enemies The Joker chooses to psychologically torment his rivals by forcing them to question what they stand for\\n\\nInheriting the character completely delivering a textbook performance that is hard to forget even days after youve watched the film the late Heath Ledger IS The Joker The greasy hair the make upsmeared face the red scar of a grin the tongue snaking out of his lips and that sloshy voice  not only is this Joker a complete contrast from Jack Nicholsons largely comic take on the same role in Tim Burtons 1989 Batman film but Heath Ledger as The Joker is undoubtedly the finest most menacing villain in any comicbook movie yet\\n\\nFor those interested purely in the spectacle value of the film theres enough to keep you excited Cars explode jails and hospitals are blown up bombs are put in peoples mouths even left in their stomachs There are some fantastic chase sequences and theres one particularly jawdropping scene in which a massive truck flips in the air like an Olympic diver Theres also the Batmobile which transforms itself into an armored tank and even a turbo motorcycle\\n\\nNaturally all this means its a long film two hours and 32 minutes to be precise  but its unlikely that youll complain because youre sucked into the drama pretty early on Allowing Ledger and The Joker to steal this film from under his nose Christian Bale as Batman takes a backseat during this ride But Nolan gives him that one magnificent scene which makes up for whatever complaints Batman might otherwise have In this scene we see Batman leaping off a Gotham skyscraper swooping down into the night his bat wings rustling in the air as he descends on the city hes here to protect Its one of the most fantastic scenes youve seen in film for a long long time And this is a fantastic film\\n\\nGo with a big bucket of popcorn and prepare to have a great time Its for the pleasure of watching films like this that reclining seats and giant screens were invented\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

I had heard various opinions praising the performances, the scenery, the soundtrack... However, I never got to see it, until today. And, after seeing it, I can affirm that it is a contender to be one of the best films in history. There is no criticizable point. Heath Ledger's performance is one of the best performances ever given on the big screen, and even the secondary characters shine. The city has a tone of horror, suffering and fear, just as someone would imagine Gotham, and all this thanks to the excellent setting that this feature film presents, both in terms of the scenery and the music, composed by the famous Hans Zimmer. Last but not least is the plot, and I can firmly say that it is one of the best I have ever heard in my life. I still can't assimilate how well the Joker's plans are made, worthy of a crazy but charismatic and cunning villain.\\n\\nIn conclusion: 10/10.\",\n          \"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.\\n\\nThis is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.\\n\\nChristopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.\\n\\nThe acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.\\n\\nThere is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.\\n\\nNo spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!\",\n          \"This film is not the masterpiece that IMDb seems to assign it as.

I had heard various opinions praising the performances, the scenery, the soundtrack... However, I never got to see it, until today. And, after seeing it, I can affirm that it is a contender to be one of the best films in history. There is no criticizable point. Heath Ledger's performance is one of the best performances ever given on the big screen, and even the secondary characters shine. The city has a tone of horror, suffering and fear, just as someone would imagine Gotham, and all this thanks to the excellent setting that this feature film presents, both in terms of the scenery and the music, composed by the famous Hans Zimmer. Last but not least is the plot, and I can firmly say that it is one of the best I have ever heard in my life. I still can't assimilate how well the Joker's plans are made, worthy of a crazy but charismatic and cunning villain.\\n\\nIn conclusion: 10/10.\",\n          \"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.\\n\\nThis is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.\\n\\nChristopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.\\n\\nThe acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.\\n\\nThere is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.\\n\\nNo spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!\",\n          \"This film is not the masterpiece that IMDb seems to assign it as.

I had heard various opinions praising the performances, the scenery, the soundtrack... However, I never got to see it, until today. And, after seeing it, I can affirm that it is a contender to be one of the best films in history. There is no criticizable point. Heath Ledger's performance is one of the best performances ever given on the big screen, and even the secondary characters shine. The city has a tone of horror, suffering and fear, just as someone would imagine Gotham, and all this thanks to the excellent setting that this feature film presents, both in terms of the scenery and the music, composed by the famous Hans Zimmer. Last but not least is the plot, and I can firmly say that it is one of the best I have ever heard in my life. I still can't assimilate how well the Joker's plans are made, worthy of a crazy but charismatic and cunning villain.\\n\\nIn conclusion: 10/10.\",\n          \"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.\\n\\nThis is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.\\n\\nChristopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.\\n\\nThe acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.\\n\\nThere is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.\\n\\nNo spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!\",\n          \"This film is not the masterpiece that IMDb seems to assign it as.
