"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there.",weve been subject to enorm amount of hype and market for the dark knight weve seen joker scaveng hunt and one of the largest viral campaign in advertis histori and it culmin with the actual releas of the movi everyth that been said is pretti much spot on thi is the first time i can rememb where a summer blockbust film far surpass the hype for a much action a there is in thi movi it the act that make it a great piec of work between all the punch explos and stuntwork is some great dialog work all the actor have their moment bale batman is the definit batman becaus we see everyth in thi charact final on film martial art skill cun great tactic think forens applic technolog geniu to advanc or improv lusciou fox inventionstechnolog breakthrough intimid person and even a littl swashbuckl a for heath ye he get credit for hi perform a the joker but you have to also recogn jonathan and chri nolan for the write and treatment of the charact it not just the fact that ledger make the joker so menac but the nolan have given the charact thi great manifesto that drive it action the joker stanc on chao order anarchi the moral of the averag modern human be make the charact so interest psycholog the nolan draft a complex charact and onli a perfect perform couldv pull someth like thi off that how difficult of a role thi wa and that whi ledger perform is so great thi isnt an action movi it a film that explor literari theme of the hero and villain a well a order and anarchi ye listen to the dialog becaus it all in there,Neutral
"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want.",i couldnt believ the dark knight could live up to the hype that perhap the biggest surpris the secret i believ is a stun matur intellig script that make it the best superhero movi ever made a if that wasnt enough heath ledger he the newest of the tragic modern icon present u with a preview of someth well never see a fearless extraordinari actor capabl to fill up with human even the most grotesqu of villain hi perform is a master class fortun christian bale batman is almost a support charact bale is good but there is someth around hi mouth that stop him from be great the dark knight is visual stun power and move what el could anyon want,Neutral
"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions.

"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.

The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!",i had the pleasur to watch thi movi in an imax theatr in london it advertis itself with the slogan biggest screen in the uk which wa one of the greatest movi experi i had in my life and it wa my first movi in an imax theatr i can onli recommend it for anyon who ha the chanc to watch it even if not the entir movi is shot for an imax theatr thi still is abl to blow someon away great visual combin with a great stori and superb act the movi could also have been call the joker but even with heath ledger great perform thi still is a batman movi and the dark knight is clear enough even without the batman in the titl i simpli love the movi but i heard some complaint from some friend it seem that some might have a problem with the depict of the charact i love heath ledger but there are a few out there who would have want to see him even crazier or the plot thread especi what is done with the charact of aaron eckhart although i can see whi that might be a problem for fan of the comic book i still stand by my vote thi is the best batman movi ever until hope nolan and bale make the next one,Neutral
"Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.

You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....

This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather.

"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace.

"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home.

"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film.

"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie.

"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.

Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.

Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.

And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.

The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made.",when i went to the cinema to see indiana jone i rememb see a trailer for the dark knight it wa dark full of explos and look realli cool be a huge fan of batman and the two burton film i couldnt wait to see it while i never saw it in cinema i rememb my friend tell me it wa amaz and one of the best film ever fast forward to when i final got to see the film and it wa a differ stori two and a half hour of the most pretenti bore and disappoint film i had ever seen let start with the plot basic the joker atleast that what they call him start kill peopl and caus mayhem mean batman ha to stop him sound simpl but the film spoil thi by have too mani plot line most of which have noth to do with the actual plot dont last long enough to be interest and could have been easili cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot now for the hero and villain batman is play by christian bale and come complet with an over the top gruff voic which sound like he smoke a entir packet of cigarett while do a cross countri marathon he nowher near a dark or a intimid a keaton batman and isnt veri engag a bruce either now for the reason the film is consid to be so great heath ledger a the joker ledger is the main drive point of the film and the most interest charact he play the role veri convincingli and ill admit is the best part of the film even though they could have call him anyth el instead of the joker and it would have been the same and that my biggest problem with thi film it doesnt feel like a batman film batman ha alway been a surreal franchis mean it walk on a line between the real world and a fantasi world whi doe gotham citi just look like and regular citi whi doe the joker not have ani comic death contrapt whi doe the batmobil look like a tank where are all batman uniqu gadget the problem is nolan doesnt understand that a man who dress up a a bat and fight crime cant be taken complet serious burton made a surreal world for batman and batman return creat a perfect environ for hi film but with nolan all i think of is just a crime drama with batman in it the joker could have been just a psycho with makeup the pace is also a flaw sometim the film move too quickli for u to digest what go on and other time it goe to slow that we lose interest onli reason peopl love it wa for heath ledger amaz perform and hi unfortun pas away befor the film releas and even that doesnt fit the bill for a batman movi to sum up the dark knight will go down in histori a the most overr film ever made,Negative
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'.",batman take on the crime lord with the help of lieuten jim gordon and district attorney harvey dent howev an even bigger evil rise to terror gotham maggi gyllenha is an improv over kati holm a rachel daw aaron eckhart add a good perform a harvey dent in the end thi is heath ledger movi he overpow everybodi hi earli death may have immort him but my opinion isnt inflat hi presenc is electr it help that hi charact is so ridicul crazi hi motiv ha noth to do with power or money which is so mundan he want chao and that is so much more fascin heath ledger make thi movi great and it surpass the seri reboot batman begin,Neutral

"I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.

This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.

I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).

There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.

I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst.",i will say up front that i have never seen a movi base on a comic book that i realli like except the anim one or the quasianim like _sin city_ you would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common but in the end theyr trade in differ kind of imag thi is basic just anoth batman movi same silli premis that a superrich hero battl over the shrink remnant of gotham citi villain with seemingli unlimit resourc in personnel and explos i will agre that heath ledger perform is amaz can thi be the same guy who play the gay cowboy in that other movi it is a real piti that he die i cant help but think that if he were still aliv and we were wonder what he would do next with hi great talent thi movi would not have an averag rate of a of thi write there are a lot of other fine actor morgan freeman and michael cain for cri out loud who are basic wast pretend to take their charact serious i did like the heist sequenc at the begin includ the joker first few line and the bit with the bu realli veri droll get your hope up but from then on it just a lot of peopl be blown up while the survivor emot angst dark brood comicbook angst,Neutral

"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.

As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.

The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.

Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.

"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy.

"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us.

It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart).

"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace.

"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage.

"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film.

"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well.

"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.

Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.

Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.

And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.

The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made.",when i went to the cinema to see indiana jone i rememb see a trailer for the dark knight it wa dark full of explos and look realli cool be a huge fan of batman and the two burton film i couldnt wait to see it while i never saw it in cinema i rememb my friend tell me it wa amaz and one of the best film ever fast forward to when i final got to see the film and it wa a differ stori two and a half hour of the most pretenti bore and disappoint film i had ever seen let start with the plot basic the joker atleast that what they call him start kill peopl and caus mayhem mean batman ha to stop him sound simpl but the film spoil thi by have too mani plot line most of which have noth to do with the actual plot dont last long enough to be interest and could have been easili cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot now for the hero and villain batman is play by christian bale and come complet with an over the top gruff voic which sound like he smoke a entir packet of cigarett while do a cross countri marathon he nowher near a dark or a intimid a keaton batman and isnt veri engag a bruce either now for the reason the film is consid to be so great heath ledger a the joker ledger is the main drive point of the film and the most interest charact he play the role veri convincingli and ill admit is the best part of the film even though they could have call him anyth el instead of the joker and it would have been the same and that my biggest problem with thi film it doesnt feel like a batman film batman ha alway been a surreal franchis mean it walk on a line between the real world and a fantasi world whi doe gotham citi just look like and regular citi whi doe the joker not have ani comic death contrapt whi doe the batmobil look like a tank where are all batman uniqu gadget the problem is nolan doesnt understand that a man who dress up a a bat and fight crime cant be taken complet serious burton made a surreal world for batman and batman return creat a perfect environ for hi film but with nolan all i think of is just a crime drama with batman in it the joker could have been just a psycho with makeup the pace is also a flaw sometim the film move too quickli for u to digest what go on and other time it goe to slow that we lose interest onli reason peopl love it wa for heath ledger amaz perform and hi unfortun pas away befor the film releas and even that doesnt fit the bill for a batman movi to sum up the dark knight will go down in histori a the most overr film ever made,Negative
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great.

"I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.

This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.

I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).

There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.

I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up.

"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.

As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.

The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.

Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.

As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN!

"This Is probably the second best sequel of all time, second only to the return of the king. I've seen this movie twice in cinema this year, that's just how good it is. I could name very few flaws in this movie. This movie has some of the best preformances of all time. Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film. However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as two-face to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers. Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times.

"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.

This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.

Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.

The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.

There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.

No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come.

"Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received.",heath ledger a the joker is brilliant and anytim he on the screen thi action film seem elev it also get the nihilist insan of the charact right a alfr michael cain so correctli put it some men just want to watch the world burn i wa less of a fan of christian bale perform a batman with hi toneless gruff voic and if im honest even the concept of the dark knight with batman san robin view a an evil vigilant by the citizen of gotham i also thought the film tri to pack too much in with the love interesttriangl maggi gyllenha rise of two face aaron eckhart and extran charact eg morgan freeman it could have also use a breather in between all the action scene though some of the element like that batpod with the extra fat tire were pretti cool it goe on way too long at minut and if it had been pare down and more focus on the joker sadist psycholog cruelti could have been a masterpiec all in all it a good entertain film but not worthi of the extraordinari high prais and rate it receiv,Positive
"In my opinion, this movie a bit over-hyped and a bit over-rated actually. Is this movie better than 12 Angry Men or Schindler's List or The Return Of The King? Absoulutely not. Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted. This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger.

"There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.

A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!

The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?

Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.

The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.

Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.

Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!

Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.

As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!",there is just one thing that differenti a legend from ordinari man it hi fight with inner demon to over come all hi fear that defin a legend and thi is what batman stand for batman is not just anoth comic charact but it a complet saga of how you stand tall in spite of lose everyth walk fearlessli even when you are lone and how you fight back against all odd and over shadow your own fear fear the most domin emot mankind ha ever wit batman is no except he still ha fear he still get scare of lose those who are close to him and he is still in doubt when it come to decis but what is interest and inspir about batman is that he ha the abil to use wise the biggest and most danger weapon of all time perfectli brain that whi he is my favourit comic charact and thi time batman is put everyth on the line to save the world from out of control freak the joker a spell bound perform by heath ledger a the joker though he is no more with u but hi immort act a joker is an oscar win perform and will alway be rememb your heart come out to mouth to see the horror joker creat in start i wa bit confus a hi perform remind me of jack nicholson from the first batman movi but later i realis that thi is for real he did not imit jack but showcas the true and horribl side of a real joker the best part about heath is that he display the flip side of a joker fearless there are mani time when we feel that some one could have done better with certain role but not here here heath is perfect a a joker and from now on i will call him heath joker ledger the stori is about a terror that ha shaken the underworld of gotham the fear of batman is get in to crimin mind and all of them are now think where their money can be save from batman reach and that where the joker come with a plan to these crimin kill batman now with hi pervert mind the joker is behind batman life and what follow is a scari hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith v courag at one end joker ha no fear and on the other batman ha a respons of save gotham now the import question is that who will win and more than that at what cost apart from break box offic record thi movi is also abl to break the pattern of film make batman seri is an action seri when you make an action movi you give the requir pace in a movi by focus on elabor the action scene but here the director build the movi with a mix of action a well a other emot scene step by step movi give it audienc action and emot at the time when it requir but with an unexpect style dark intens and a complet batman style the batman movi are famou for it back ground music and the dark knight is no except special when there is sound of a whistl in background of some intens scene in the movi i felt a rush in to my blood and boil my brain my eye pop out while watch those scene to mention batman grill session with the joker is a masterpiec the scene wa simpli awesom mainli coz of background music harvey dent charact could have been better post he becom face i wa expect hi charact to be more involv and longer in the seri rachel daw is also a veri strong influenc charact in the movi her involv in the movi is much focus than kati holm in batman begin but the point im make here is the glam factor in thi movi she wa not given that much footag in a glamor way nevertheless the plot did not allow audienc to think that way either action scene in thi movi are well thought of and will chill the audienc spinal chord my favourit is the chase scene where joker is tri best to catch harvey dent and how batman come in between thi is where batman say asta la vista and welcom hi new girl friend hi damn new bike it call batpod i can imagin how excit you will be when you know that batman is now go to catch the joker and joker is happi that batman ha miss hi shot thi is sheer delight to watch the creativ involv of special effect blend with brilliant cinematographi unlik other hollywood flick the dark knight is a lengthi movi of more than ½ hr of nonstop adrenalin but you wont mind spend that much time watch it mani time we feel that some movi couldv been shorter and some lengthier but with the dark knight that not the case it mainli becaus the movi end up at the time when it is requir to scroll the curtain down i wa so satisfi while come out from the movi hall perfect end well the dark knight is just a begin now im expect the penguin and the riddler to come in to the pictur and take thi battl ahead a i said earlier im a big fan of batman and after thi movi im mad about not just batman but each and everi part of hi movi music and the joker now while im rush straight to the nearest movi store to buy all origin movi and soundtrack of batman seri you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the joker or batman choic is your,Positive

One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight, despite these movies being in a series.

"Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.

Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.

I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.

This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.

Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.

I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.

Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice.

"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all.",it is odd to spend more than two hour watch a film and it slowli dawn on you that you are not particularli bother how it end and if anyth rather wish it would end sooner rather than later the dark knight is that kind of film exactli whi i lost interest or even when im not too sure but lose interest i did thi is christoph nolan second stab at batman a well a christian rant bale and although all the element are there it is simpli not a good natur thi be anoth slug blast and punchfest tho despit it reput for be dark thank not a bloodfest mani mani viewer have laud thi a a masterpiec the best movi of so far far surpass begin no it isnt and no it doesnt all i can say is that these peopl have not seen mani masterpiec or mani film in the dark knight in that way which hollywood ha made it sugari own attempt to flatter the audienc by includ a moral dilemma and it doe so not onc but rather often thi time we are invit the we be the popcornchew saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxuri to reflect on moral ambigu and how rel rather than absolut the notion of good and evil can be and each time thi viewer sigh a littl a the say goe you can put lipstick on a pig but it is still a pig we get ani number of high falutin speech about hero and villain but in truth is just so much codswallop in truth thi film is just anoth blockbust and at that it is not even a good a mani other blockbust if you want to medit on the realiti of good and evil of hero and villain by all mean make a film do so but in the dark knight it is all for thi viewer at least all veri phoney apart from that thi film is a tad confus there are too mani charact the plot or at least what there is of it realli doe not bear repeat the suspens is curious unexcit and too often the film drag the old actor are there and all with the veri honour except of the late heath ledger seem to be act by number thi wa i think ledger last film and hi earli death is sad undoubtedli he wa veri talent and have said all that there is not much more to say it not bad it not particularli good a part of the seri it stand tall but then the seri is not all that outstand see it if you want to and if after read thi you decid not to well sorri but you wont be miss much at all,Neutral

"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil. Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down. To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas. It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in.

"When Batman Begins was released in the year 2005, I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series, that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny, playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of Batman..

So when I went to watch this movie, I was ready to see the Heath Ledger's Joker cracking some jokes, blowing up lots of places, killing tons of people, going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..

Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work..

Other actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully.

This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, For those of you who haven't watched it yet, I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely..",when batman begin wa releas in the year i watch it and wonder see the end scene where the joker wa reveal to be the villain in the next instal of the seri that well how christoph nolan is gonna incorpor the funni play and complet insan charact of the joker in to hi dark and seriou version of batman so when i went to watch thi movi i wa readi to see the heath ledger joker crack some joke blow up lot of place kill ton of peopl go way beyond insan and of cours laugh a lot but the joker i saw wa rather just the opposit he did blow up build he did kill peopl he did go insan and laugh but he did all of thi with a motiv and a touch of control and calm to it it been a while sinc i have seen a movi where the villain shine more than the hero and in thi movi heath ledger joker complet stole the show everyth he doe seem reason and the thing that he say feel honest and true the movi grip you throughout it min runtim christoph nolan nail it and show how comic book charact can be taken out of their color world put in a dark and seriou movi and make it work other actor also play their part well christian bale wa good a batmanbruc wayn aaron eckhart wa brilliant a harvey dent gari oldman maggi gyllenha michael cain and morgan freeman play their role beauti thi movi is one of my favorit movi of all time for those of you who havent watch it yet i recommend you watch it a soon a possibl becaus thi kind of gem come rare,Positive

"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it.

But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.

Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it.

But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film.

"A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling.

It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time.

Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic.

The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.

Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.

An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.

Superior to pretty much everything else.

"The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.

The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: ""I'm not wearing hockey pads!"" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed.

The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname ""the Dark Knight"" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.

It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the﻿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.

The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes.

"The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.

The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much ""face time"" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.

Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right.",the dark knight wa probabl the best action film ive ever seen not onli is the design tone special fx sound and music all were excel but the script wa den complex and thorough the perform from the actor were all veri good particularli ledger who took the joker into a realm of sociopath that weve not seen in a batman charact befor thi may be ledger best perform from hi all too short career the onli issu i have is the extrem gross and gori of the twofac make upspeci fx i think it goe a bit too far to have littl bit of flesh dangl from hi visibl bone structur the onli thing i believ that wa better from the previou bat man seri but the director doesnt use too much face time on that charact so the look remain shock and not overdon certainli the dark knight will stand out for quit some time a the best comic book movi a it ha that a it root howev it may also stand a a masterpiec in it own right,Neutral
"The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him, but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film; the camera-work was excellent, the pace was gripping, the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid.

"I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.

The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.

Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.

I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.

If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now.

You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it.

"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.

*Runs*

The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.

Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?

We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?

Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.

Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.

Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven.",i have the flame suit on ive alreadi call my lawyer ive prepar fake passport and bought sever differ alias to run by i have also transfer my fund to a european account whi so seriou becaus here we go the dark knight is not the epic piec of godli art that everyon is hype it to be run the dark knight is a good piec of work a decent movi but doe not fall into nearperfect by ani mean despit the amaz perform write and action sequenc the heart and core of the comic book flavor is sever miss issu from batman begin is carri over and repeat here even though they arent a easi to spot thi is much better than begin but still fail to total era the memori of burton vision of batman resembl more the godfath and heat rather than a flick like iron man or spiderman it a total differ sort of movi involv superhero and supervillian gotham citi still doesnt truli look like gotham citi start the movi is a bank robberi unlik ani other set the tone of the movi instantli we see the joker heath ledger stir some earli troubl with the mob and crime lord we then see batman imit lurk about last but not least we see bruce wayn ex maggi gyllenha around the arm of anoth man harvey dent aaron eckhart then run amok throughout the minut of the dark knight are action sequenc plot twist sever surpris sever close call and a whole lot of crime drama good v evil is a battl that is horrif blur and human natur surround gotham citi is be test all the tension is overcom bruce wayn and batman and he begin question hi motiv and placement within the citi the write staff threw in plenti of deep and engag dialogu amongst all the action we see onscreen it a batman fan dream come true or is it we can start by credit heath ledger for a fine perform a the joker but if ledger deserv an oscar for hi role so should nicholson back in becaus believ there are mani similar in term of perform the joker here is cynic merciless and is bent on anarchi for no reasonbut so wa joker in if ledger win the oscar then jack himself should be accept it on hi behalf christian bale yet again fail a batman with hi frustrat raspi voic a bruce wayn he nail it but a batman he still need a bit of work when batman start monolog it hard not to cring the rest of the cast doe a good job most notabl gari oldman a lt gordon let also not forget morgan freedman michael cain aaron eckhart and maggi gyllenha the biggest strength of the batman univers lie within the balanc of batman and hi villain almost all of them have some sort of connect with our hero howev the treatment of villain yet again is disappoint a we see a few villain limit to mere cameo and the joker himself despit the trailer doe not get a much screen time a you may assum in the infam version we saw the joker rise from lowli punk crimin to a seriou threat to the entir citi in the dark knight unlik batman there is liter no explan a to whi he is the way he is there is no backstori reveal noth that could possibl explain hi physic appear and mental state sure he may craft some tale but whi believ a madman tale a he wield a knife to your lip dark knight best moment were not the action sequenc but the immens tension and suspens predat the payoff rare could you predict the outcom of some of the conflict and for the most part all the payoff were grand sometim lead to applaus the chase and actionpack moment themselv were also wellcraft and made great use of special effect yet with so mani problem fli at you at the same time it imposs to expect them all to be conclud and wrap up in the end nolan direct is stun from time to time but then he run out of steam toward the end of the third act when the movi is almost finish the end albeit unexpect wa a bit underwhelm and quit vagu especi consid the fact that the dark knight is minut long bottom line the neg is sprinkl about in thi review but dont let that fool you the dark knight is inde a great blockbust flick that will have you forget that there popcorn and soda by your side from the dazzl perform of the late heath ledger to the carefullyconstruct action sequenc that keep the pace flow there is plenti to prais about that be said it still not the best superhero movi of alltim batman is a comic book and the cast of thi new franchis must rememb thi you can dwell a much realism a youd like but the fact remain that thi isnt a realist franchis nor should it ever be treat a such gotham citi is still miss it gritti gothic dark architectur and style of burton film and need more emphasi on the villain that are in batman world the villain are the yang to the batman mytholog and batman himself is the yin you cant have too much of one and not enough of the other while it isnt batman and robin or fantast four both of them the dark knight still fall short of masterpiec qualiti simpli becaus of it exchang of comic book style for realist crime drama the dark knight is a great ride but not an epic one to qualiti heaven,Positive
"Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: ""If you only see one movie this summer, this is it"". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.

I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.

Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.

So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again.",rememb those say that magazin or critic would say one of the more popular one wa if you onli see one movi thi summer thi is it well until now i never understood that too well but now i realli realli do the dark knight is that movi a plain a i can say it the dark knight is by far the greatest most entertain movi releas all year period i had the privileg of see an advanc show for manag onli in imax about a week befor thi movi releas i wa ecstat that not onli wa i see thi much anticip movi a week earli but it wa my first imax experi if you have the option definit go with imax it wa unbeliev realli it felt like you were fli thru gotham citi about to fall into anoth scheme by the joker but enough about imax how about the movi well batman begin receiv exemplari rate from critic about an out of on imdb if i recal correctli a well sinc batman begin turn out so well and end with batman receiv word of the joker everi fan wa readi for thi movi asap just a short quick year later we final got the dark knight the main attract for thi show wa heath ledger part after hi sudden death some will be say that thi wa one of hi best perform and i can agre strongli the joker wa thrill yet comic heath brought out the dark villain even though he is well a joker all hi phrase and say made the movi what it wa but it still kept your mindset in fright mode veri hard to tackl look back on everi scene notic it wa hour and some odd minut i can not find a scene unnecessari few movi bare the except of be insan long but not at all bore and thi one fit that perfectli veri long veri detail but with patron pay that imax ticket price you want everi minut you can get i also could not find ani flaw realli with the movi except for the cast of maggi gyllenha anyon but kati holm wouldnt be good enough i mean maggi is pretti but not nearli a good look a kati holm sort of ruin her charact for me she is veri talent though absolut so after all wa said and done thi movi to me wa just about perfect out of christoph nolan absolut took batman to a new level and said forget the rest thi is top notch i want to watch it again,Neutral

"Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman).

This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.

A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨, ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part.

"The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot.

Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him.

My inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.

The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going.

As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be.",the dark knight is an intens power dramat and compel film but despit that im not sure i realli enjoy it a great deal i saw it on the huge imax screen in london which ha an abil to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film but at the same time variou aspect of the film meant that i felt alien from the charact and the plot who is batman and what do we realli know about him after have watch the whole film all hour of it im not sure i could say what are hi motiv doe he realli love rachel inde doe he have the capac to love at all again hint are given but the central charact is so poorli develop that it make it hard to realli care about what happen to him or those around him my inabl to empathis with the charact wasnt help by the ridicul number of subplot most of which are rush or incomplet and the relentless pace at which the film move from one to the other the film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storylin and develop the charact and theme within that the frenzi sequenc of larg unrel action setpiec whilst initi breathtak end up feel dull and predict what wa lack in between the explos wa anyth resembl meaning dialogu a few mumbl word from batman and some inan muse from the joker werent enough to keep the film go a such i left the film feel somewhat exhaust at the bleak joyless violent world i had wit and disappoint that thi muchhyp film just hadnt been a good a i wa hope it would be,Negative

"I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.

The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.

The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.

The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.

And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.

There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.

Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",i grew up on the anim seri love the first two batman film sort of like batman forev but disappoint in batman and robin i have yet to rewatch batman begin but i thoroughli enjoy thi film on rewatch have realli like it first time it is veri well made and grip with some great perform but person i would put casablanca wizard of oz amadeu and it a wonder life over thi the film doe suffer from be a littl too talki and the plot on occas can be hard to follow due to a lot go on nevertheless it is extrem good and not onli one of the better batman movi but also one of the better superhero movi visual and technic the film cannot be fault the cinematographi is superb and the spectacl of gotham citi is dazzl christoph nolan direct is taut and ensur that the action is explos the plot is a littl bloat with the joker bent on destroy organis crime for good and make batman cross between hero and vigilant and subplot about harvey dent and rachel daw and hong kong but there are some truli effect scene that are tightli structur and the screenplay in gener while a littl too talki in the first twenti minut is intellig and sophist the joker especi ha some veri sinist line that stay with you for a long while afterward the music by none other than maestro han zimmer who also compos music for the lion king gladiat and the pirat of the caribbean movi is outstand rous beauti haunt it is definit memor and doesnt becom forgett or gener like the music in the hurt locker for exampl and i have to say the sound engin here is phenomen particularli on veri high volum the explos sound veri authent a if they are come from outsid rather than from in the film and i have to mention the act a that wa terrif christian bale manag to be dark brood and charismat like batman should be though if i did have a complaint he doe speak in a veri hoar voic a if he got a sore throat and i somehow did not know what to make of it it wasnt irrit or anyth justodd anyway aaron eckhart is terrif a harvey denttwofac even if hi storylin wa a tad too rush and maggi gyllenha is veri sensit and care a rachel morgan freeman doe well in a smaller role a doe the excel gari oldman and michael cain is perfect a the loyal butler alfr there is no doubt in my mind that heath ledger gave the best perform of the film he wasnt just brilliant he wa phenomen unpredict insan extrem sinist and corrupt not to mention chillingli psychot i am torn on who i prefer over jack nicolson or heath ledger it is a veri close call i admit i am more familiar with nicolson portray and like hi mix of the scari and comic and even tragic joker but the joker here in the dark knight is truli sinist and even more of a threat to batman and in my opinion thi joker ha line that linger longer into the memori overal not absolut perfect but it is extrem good thank to primarili ledger perform and the dazzl visual spectacl bethani cox,Positive

"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight* is not just a superhero film; it is a gripping crime drama that transcends its genre to deliver a profound narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the human condition.

The film masterfully balances action with deep character development, showcasing Batman's struggle against not only external threats but also his internal demons. The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, particularly Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, which redefines the archetype of the villain. Ledger's Joker is chilling and chaotic, serving as the perfect foil to Batman's quest for justice.

Nolan's direction is taut, crafting a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The screenplay is sharp, blending intense action sequences with thought-provoking dialogue that raises significant ethical questions about the nature of heroism versus vigilantism.

The cinematography and score further elevate the film, with the haunting themes underscoring the emotional weight of the story. Each frame is meticulously crafted, contributing to an immersive experience that draws audiences into Gotham's dark underbelly.

Overall, *The Dark Knight* is a landmark in filmmaking that demands to be experienced. It is not only a thrilling ride filled with unforgettable moments but also a poignant exploration of the dichotomy between order and chaos, making it a film that resonates long after the credits roll.

"When I watched the dark knight for the first time, I was about 16 and I had mixed feelings towards it, I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer. Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after 'watching and having few knowledge' about some critically acclaimed films like ""the departed"", "" Inception "" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre .It was a game changer for my taste in films. It still tops the superhero genre even after 14 years of it's release. The only superhero/comic book film which comes close to this one is ""Logan"" in my opinion. So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of it's exploration towards many themes like human nature, dark reality of society, nature of lies, true and false characteristics and many more. Considering other parameters like cinematography, background score and screenplay, I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolan's films. So I end my review here, thanks for reading.

"""The Dark Knight"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic success that transcends the superhero genre, leaving a lasting mark on the world of film. Nolan masterfully weaves a complex and morally ambiguous take of chaos and order, exploring the thin line between heroism and villainy. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is legendary! He is a force of nature and added layers of depth to the character. Heath Ledger steals every scene with a magnetic presence that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. Christopher Nolan's vision, coupled with Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance makes it an instant modern classic.",the dark knight isnt just a movi it a cinemat success that transcend the superhero genr leav a last mark on the world of film nolan master weav a complex and moral ambigu take of chao and order explor the thin line between heroism and villaini heath ledger portray of the joker is legendari he is a forc of natur and ad layer of depth to the charact heath ledger steal everi scene with a magnet presenc that is both terrifi and mesmer christoph nolan vision coupl with heath ledger unforgett perform make it an instant modern classic,Neutral

"Quite simply ""Dark Knight"" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a ""proper"" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).

Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't ""just"" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of ""dark"" and of perception of ""society."" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.

Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these ""abilities"" about him which are soooo unrealistic.

So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.

The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!

I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!

Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.

It's cool It's original It's awesome

"Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.

""The Dark Knight"" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from ""Prison Break"", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but ""sometimes the truth is not good enough"".

"Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from cliché, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good.",write thi review at the tail end of open weekend the dark knight ha broken the record for open weekend and deservedli so thi film is a stepabov the standard summer blockbust howev the film also sit atop imdb top film of alltim list a rank that wont last nearli a long a it boxoffic rank line have been long to see thi film and mani of those who are vote on thi open weekend are diehard who wait in line and were readi to love thi film regardless of what it offer of cours the fact that thi film stand alon in it genr in term of write cinematographi art design and plot help boost it rate into the stratospher but when the non diehard begin to watch and vote well see thi film settl into it right place somewher in the top of all time it one of those few film that is entertain and access enough to plea the same peopl who went out in drove for spiderman while artist and smart enough to plea the more discern cinemat audienc truli disturb the charact were far from cliché a one would expect from the genr no charact is allgood or allbad ledger joker come close but earn a touch of sympathi none of the hero are flawless which is a sign of ani good film my singl complaint besid the variou hardtobeliev fall batman surviv is the rate thi film is fartoo disturb to garner a pg rate and deal with the ugliest side of human in a way that should probabl be accompani by a good convers that can add some perspect yet anoth reason whi thi film is so good,Negative
"And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like ""awesome"" and ""fantastic"" are thrown around way too much. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the plot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not in the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in almost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil.

The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace.

I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool.

I guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype.

"First of all, no I don't think this movie is bad. But I don't think it should be thought of as the gold standart for comic book movies. Because honestly, this movie doesn't feel like a comic book.

This is a very good action movie, that dresses it's main protagonist and antagonist as comic book characters. And here I think lies the problem.

This is a movie about a billionaire, dressed as a bat, who beats an anarchist clown. And Christopher Nolan tries to make this look serious. I'm sorry, it doesn't work. It just takes away the comic book feeling. And therefore it becomes a little boring. If Heath Ledger isn't on the screen I find myself hardly invested in what's happening.

To be honest, I never really liked this movie that much. Maybe because I first watched when I was 8 and it felt boring. But I watched it a few times in later years and I still remember only pieces of fractions of what's happening, outside of scenes that have the Joker. And to be fair, I probably wouldn't have remembered those pieces, if I didn't watch reviews out of boredom.

I went online to see if there is anybody who feels the same way and they all said the same thing: Heath Ledger single handedly saves this movie. And while his performance is spectacular, I can't think of him as a definitive Joker. He is good for this movie, but I'm not sure if I can see him fit in other Batman movies. And a personal bias of mine is that no one is ever going to top Mark Hamill. However, Ledger did his own thing and he did good. Unlike other main charachters in the movie, this one won people over. But it's still in a movie that plays everything too serious.

It feels like Nolan took the main charachters from a comic book and put them in this, just because otherwise it would have been just another action movie. It lacks a certain element. It lacks that comic book campiness, that even the most serious comic books have a pinch of in them. And therefore it fails to deliver as a comic book movie.

That's not to say that being serious is a bad change. Too many comic book are corny as hell and very often it gets annoying. But if you get too serious, you get boring. One should not be at the expense of the other. One must find a balance between the comic book campiness and the seriousness of the real world.

To quote a certain character: Why so serious?",first of all no i dont think thi movi is bad but i dont think it should be thought of a the gold standart for comic book movi becaus honestli thi movi doesnt feel like a comic book thi is a veri good action movi that dress it main protagonist and antagonist a comic book charact and here i think lie the problem thi is a movi about a billionair dress a a bat who beat an anarchist clown and christoph nolan tri to make thi look seriou im sorri it doesnt work it just take away the comic book feel and therefor it becom a littl bore if heath ledger isnt on the screen i find myself hardli invest in what happen to be honest i never realli like thi movi that much mayb becaus i first watch when i wa and it felt bore but i watch it a few time in later year and i still rememb onli piec of fraction of what happen outsid of scene that have the joker and to be fair i probabl wouldnt have rememb those piec if i didnt watch review out of boredom i went onlin to see if there is anybodi who feel the same way and they all said the same thing heath ledger singl handedli save thi movi and while hi perform is spectacular i cant think of him a a definit joker he is good for thi movi but im not sure if i can see him fit in other batman movi and a person bia of mine is that no one is ever go to top mark hamil howev ledger did hi own thing and he did good unlik other main characht in the movi thi one won peopl over but it still in a movi that play everyth too seriou it feel like nolan took the main characht from a comic book and put them in thi just becaus otherwis it would have been just anoth action movi it lack a certain element it lack that comic book campi that even the most seriou comic book have a pinch of in them and therefor it fail to deliv a a comic book movi that not to say that be seriou is a bad chang too mani comic book are corni a hell and veri often it get annoy but if you get too seriou you get bore one should not be at the expens of the other one must find a balanc between the comic book campi and the serious of the real world to quot a certain charact whi so seriou,Positive
"The Dark Knight actually got lucky. Movies over the last six years have been crap. Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.

It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.

The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining. Besides, movies over the last few years are all dark - even the light-hearted ones.

"for weeks leading up to the film movie insiders have been claiming that not only is it the best batman movie but that heath ledger deserves a Oscar nod for his work as the joker here is my short take on the film sorry its 4am and i just got home. the film overall is about as good as its every going to get as a action film and as a film on its own i really do think as of what i have seen so far it deserves at least a Oscar nom for best film the acting alround is just top shelf stuff. i will say this the film felt abit long but it needed to be. OK on to the cast, batman from watching the trailers and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i was worried that batman would be pushed into the back....this is not the case. the film overall doesn't follow one person it follows the story and i think thats what makes it such a good movie cause in the end the story is the important part. OK my one knock on the film heath ledgers joker was good but i didn't think it was Oscar good, i will say he holds his own with jack's joker....actually i think its better but i don't think is Oscar good. i liked the way they used him in the film he pops in does the damage and pops out and it really works best that way. now Aaron Eckhart's two face/dent makes tommy lee's a joke....but really aaron take on both dent and twoface were amazing the characters are taken to deep levels and it really gave the film a extra kick and props to the special effects guys it looked so real. bale i think carries the story well just like in begins while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movie over all turns out better for it, and its not like he doesn't have his moments ether. Gyllenhaal replaces homes and honestly i would have rather homes im not saying she did a bad job i just think with home's work on thank you for smoking she would have been a better choice if they could of had her. or wanted her? finally the supports of freeman caine and oldmen work just as well as they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of his screen time overall its easy to say this is by far the best of the batman movies. if i had to compare it to anything its like saying batman begins is like a star war iv and D.K is like EP:v both are good but this one just takes it that next level up",for week lead up to the film movi insid have been claim that not onli is it the best batman movi but that heath ledger deserv a oscar nod for hi work a the joker here is my short take on the film sorri it am and i just got home the film overal is about a good a it everi go to get a a action film and a a film on it own i realli do think a of what i have seen so far it deserv at least a oscar nom for best film the act alround is just top shelf stuff i will say thi the film felt abit long but it need to be ok on to the cast batman from watch the trailer and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i wa worri that batman would be push into the backthi is not the case the film overal doesnt follow one person it follow the stori and i think that what make it such a good movi caus in the end the stori is the import part ok my one knock on the film heath ledger joker wa good but i didnt think it wa oscar good i will say he hold hi own with jack jokeractu i think it better but i dont think is oscar good i like the way they use him in the film he pop in doe the damag and pop out and it realli work best that way now aaron eckhart two faced make tommi lee a jokebut realli aaron take on both dent and twofac were amaz the charact are taken to deep level and it realli gave the film a extra kick and prop to the special effect guy it look so real bale i think carri the stori well just like in begin while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movi over all turn out better for it and it not like he doesnt have hi moment ether gyllenha replac home and honestli i would have rather home im not say she did a bad job i just think with home work on thank you for smoke she would have been a better choic if they could of had her or want her final the support of freeman cain and oldmen work just a well a they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of hi screen time overal it easi to say thi is by far the best of the batman movi if i had to compar it to anyth it like say batman begin is like a star war iv and dk is like epv both are good but thi one just take it that next level up,Positive

"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there.",weve been subject to enorm amount of hype and market for the dark knight weve seen joker scaveng hunt and one of the largest viral campaign in advertis histori and it culmin with the actual releas of the movi everyth that been said is pretti much spot on thi is the first time i can rememb where a summer blockbust film far surpass the hype for a much action a there is in thi movi it the act that make it a great piec of work between all the punch explos and stuntwork is some great dialog work all the actor have their moment bale batman is the definit batman becaus we see everyth in thi charact final on film martial art skill cun great tactic think forens applic technolog geniu to advanc or improv lusciou fox inventionstechnolog breakthrough intimid person and even a littl swashbuckl a for heath ye he get credit for hi perform a the joker but you have to also recogn jonathan and chri nolan for the write and treatment of the charact it not just the fact that ledger make the joker so menac but the nolan have given the charact thi great manifesto that drive it action the joker stanc on chao order anarchi the moral of the averag modern human be make the charact so interest psycholog the nolan draft a complex charact and onli a perfect perform couldv pull someth like thi off that how difficult of a role thi wa and that whi ledger perform is so great thi isnt an action movi it a film that explor literari theme of the hero and villain a well a order and anarchi ye listen to the dialog becaus it all in there,Neutral
"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script.

A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great.

"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions.

"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.

The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote.

"Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction?

This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more.

"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace.

"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

"I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.

Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.

"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!",well here it is one of the most anticip movi of the year so far how wa it it wa excel by far the best batman film ever made and of cours it will be one of the most memor action film for a long while everyon wa wait to see how well heath ledger perform a the joker in thi film he definit deserv an oscar in hi honor the charact wa so dark and creepi that it sent chill up my back compar to heath other film like thing i hate about you and even brokeback mountain prove that thi man could actual act doesnt matter what charact he could do it the film storylin ha mani twist and all are reward the stori is develop constantli after each scene make you wonder what next excel craft and flow well toward the conclus dure the film on the scene with batman against the joker bike v truck peopl thought thi wa the end no it kept go which wa awesom the stori kept get darker and darker i guess that whi they call it the dark knight a well a the relat to batman himself the cast wa great with christoph nolan play batman good perform heath ledger play extrem well maggi wa annoy at time but still deserv to be prais michael cain and morgan freeman had minor role which satisfi the audienc aaron eckhart start with a minor role which slowli progress and becom evil which is quit surpris and entertain to watch great direct made the movi enjoy they ad more action thi time which made the film feel power light wa done well especi show harvey two face face in the mani mood he display great explos made it entertain made you feel great that thi is final the best action to come in a long time thi movi deserv a rate and credit on behalf of the great young actor heath ledger life may he rip hi perform made what thi film is right now i recommend thi film for ani action fan especi a batman fan or if your even a heath ledger fan go ahead right now and see thi film it great,Neutral

"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10.",the actor the script the sceneri make it one of the best movi i have ever seen the bestplay charact of the joker is amaz that how i imagin him in the film he is portray a an ultraintellig person with a psychopath brain honestli i wa veri surpris that someon known for their nich product would play such a good role a one of the most import charact in the batman seri unfortun we will probabl never see the joker so well again becaus heath ledger from unknown circumst die thi is sad news howev back to the movi the main charact batman play by christian bale also show the charact veri well therefor my rate for thi movi is,Neutral
"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.

Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.

Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.

And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.

The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made.",when i went to the cinema to see indiana jone i rememb see a trailer for the dark knight it wa dark full of explos and look realli cool be a huge fan of batman and the two burton film i couldnt wait to see it while i never saw it in cinema i rememb my friend tell me it wa amaz and one of the best film ever fast forward to when i final got to see the film and it wa a differ stori two and a half hour of the most pretenti bore and disappoint film i had ever seen let start with the plot basic the joker atleast that what they call him start kill peopl and caus mayhem mean batman ha to stop him sound simpl but the film spoil thi by have too mani plot line most of which have noth to do with the actual plot dont last long enough to be interest and could have been easili cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot now for the hero and villain batman is play by christian bale and come complet with an over the top gruff voic which sound like he smoke a entir packet of cigarett while do a cross countri marathon he nowher near a dark or a intimid a keaton batman and isnt veri engag a bruce either now for the reason the film is consid to be so great heath ledger a the joker ledger is the main drive point of the film and the most interest charact he play the role veri convincingli and ill admit is the best part of the film even though they could have call him anyth el instead of the joker and it would have been the same and that my biggest problem with thi film it doesnt feel like a batman film batman ha alway been a surreal franchis mean it walk on a line between the real world and a fantasi world whi doe gotham citi just look like and regular citi whi doe the joker not have ani comic death contrapt whi doe the batmobil look like a tank where are all batman uniqu gadget the problem is nolan doesnt understand that a man who dress up a a bat and fight crime cant be taken complet serious burton made a surreal world for batman and batman return creat a perfect environ for hi film but with nolan all i think of is just a crime drama with batman in it the joker could have been just a psycho with makeup the pace is also a flaw sometim the film move too quickli for u to digest what go on and other time it goe to slow that we lose interest onli reason peopl love it wa for heath ledger amaz perform and hi unfortun pas away befor the film releas and even that doesnt fit the bill for a batman movi to sum up the dark knight will go down in histori a the most overr film ever made,Negative
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'.",batman take on the crime lord with the help of lieuten jim gordon and district attorney harvey dent howev an even bigger evil rise to terror gotham maggi gyllenha is an improv over kati holm a rachel daw aaron eckhart add a good perform a harvey dent in the end thi is heath ledger movi he overpow everybodi hi earli death may have immort him but my opinion isnt inflat hi presenc is electr it help that hi charact is so ridicul crazi hi motiv ha noth to do with power or money which is so mundan he want chao and that is so much more fascin heath ledger make thi movi great and it surpass the seri reboot batman begin,Neutral

"I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.

This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.

I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).

There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.

I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst.",i will say up front that i have never seen a movi base on a comic book that i realli like except the anim one or the quasianim like _sin city_ you would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common but in the end theyr trade in differ kind of imag thi is basic just anoth batman movi same silli premis that a superrich hero battl over the shrink remnant of gotham citi villain with seemingli unlimit resourc in personnel and explos i will agre that heath ledger perform is amaz can thi be the same guy who play the gay cowboy in that other movi it is a real piti that he die i cant help but think that if he were still aliv and we were wonder what he would do next with hi great talent thi movi would not have an averag rate of a of thi write there are a lot of other fine actor morgan freeman and michael cain for cri out loud who are basic wast pretend to take their charact serious i did like the heist sequenc at the begin includ the joker first few line and the bit with the bu realli veri droll get your hope up but from then on it just a lot of peopl be blown up while the survivor emot angst dark brood comicbook angst,Neutral

"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.

As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.

The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.

Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.

"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.

This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.

Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.

The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.

There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.

"Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received.",heath ledger a the joker is brilliant and anytim he on the screen thi action film seem elev it also get the nihilist insan of the charact right a alfr michael cain so correctli put it some men just want to watch the world burn i wa less of a fan of christian bale perform a batman with hi toneless gruff voic and if im honest even the concept of the dark knight with batman san robin view a an evil vigilant by the citizen of gotham i also thought the film tri to pack too much in with the love interesttriangl maggi gyllenha rise of two face aaron eckhart and extran charact eg morgan freeman it could have also use a breather in between all the action scene though some of the element like that batpod with the extra fat tire were pretti cool it goe on way too long at minut and if it had been pare down and more focus on the joker sadist psycholog cruelti could have been a masterpiec all in all it a good entertain film but not worthi of the extraordinari high prais and rate it receiv,Positive
"In my opinion, this movie a bit over-hyped and a bit over-rated actually. Is this movie better than 12 Angry Men or Schindler's List or The Return Of The King? Absoulutely not. Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted. This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger.

"There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.

A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!

The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?

Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.

The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.

Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.

Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!

Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.

As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!",there is just one thing that differenti a legend from ordinari man it hi fight with inner demon to over come all hi fear that defin a legend and thi is what batman stand for batman is not just anoth comic charact but it a complet saga of how you stand tall in spite of lose everyth walk fearlessli even when you are lone and how you fight back against all odd and over shadow your own fear fear the most domin emot mankind ha ever wit batman is no except he still ha fear he still get scare of lose those who are close to him and he is still in doubt when it come to decis but what is interest and inspir about batman is that he ha the abil to use wise the biggest and most danger weapon of all time perfectli brain that whi he is my favourit comic charact and thi time batman is put everyth on the line to save the world from out of control freak the joker a spell bound perform by heath ledger a the joker though he is no more with u but hi immort act a joker is an oscar win perform and will alway be rememb your heart come out to mouth to see the horror joker creat in start i wa bit confus a hi perform remind me of jack nicholson from the first batman movi but later i realis that thi is for real he did not imit jack but showcas the true and horribl side of a real joker the best part about heath is that he display the flip side of a joker fearless there are mani time when we feel that some one could have done better with certain role but not here here heath is perfect a a joker and from now on i will call him heath joker ledger the stori is about a terror that ha shaken the underworld of gotham the fear of batman is get in to crimin mind and all of them are now think where their money can be save from batman reach and that where the joker come with a plan to these crimin kill batman now with hi pervert mind the joker is behind batman life and what follow is a scari hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith v courag at one end joker ha no fear and on the other batman ha a respons of save gotham now the import question is that who will win and more than that at what cost apart from break box offic record thi movi is also abl to break the pattern of film make batman seri is an action seri when you make an action movi you give the requir pace in a movi by focus on elabor the action scene but here the director build the movi with a mix of action a well a other emot scene step by step movi give it audienc action and emot at the time when it requir but with an unexpect style dark intens and a complet batman style the batman movi are famou for it back ground music and the dark knight is no except special when there is sound of a whistl in background of some intens scene in the movi i felt a rush in to my blood and boil my brain my eye pop out while watch those scene to mention batman grill session with the joker is a masterpiec the scene wa simpli awesom mainli coz of background music harvey dent charact could have been better post he becom face i wa expect hi charact to be more involv and longer in the seri rachel daw is also a veri strong influenc charact in the movi her involv in the movi is much focus than kati holm in batman begin but the point im make here is the glam factor in thi movi she wa not given that much footag in a glamor way nevertheless the plot did not allow audienc to think that way either action scene in thi movi are well thought of and will chill the audienc spinal chord my favourit is the chase scene where joker is tri best to catch harvey dent and how batman come in between thi is where batman say asta la vista and welcom hi new girl friend hi damn new bike it call batpod i can imagin how excit you will be when you know that batman is now go to catch the joker and joker is happi that batman ha miss hi shot thi is sheer delight to watch the creativ involv of special effect blend with brilliant cinematographi unlik other hollywood flick the dark knight is a lengthi movi of more than ½ hr of nonstop adrenalin but you wont mind spend that much time watch it mani time we feel that some movi couldv been shorter and some lengthier but with the dark knight that not the case it mainli becaus the movi end up at the time when it is requir to scroll the curtain down i wa so satisfi while come out from the movi hall perfect end well the dark knight is just a begin now im expect the penguin and the riddler to come in to the pictur and take thi battl ahead a i said earlier im a big fan of batman and after thi movi im mad about not just batman but each and everi part of hi movi music and the joker now while im rush straight to the nearest movi store to buy all origin movi and soundtrack of batman seri you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the joker or batman choic is your,Positive

"11 years after Gotham City was rocked by Heath Ledger's Joker, The Dark Knight is still holding the title as the greatest superhero movie ever made.

This movie will forever be the film every future Batman movie will be measured against. The Dark Knight is my idea of the perfect movie completing various character arcs and requiring no build up. One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight, despite these movies being in a series. The Avengers films require the previous Marvel MCU films to be seen prior to the superheroes fighting Loki, Ultron, and Thanos.

This is a film that all should see. Performance from Christian Bale is spot on yet still over shadowed by the amazing Heath Ledger. His joker is undoubtedly the best.

The fact Christian's performance is superb and still you remember the joker, shows what a practically perfect performance they both gave. Ability to share the screen without scene stealing and just enhancing each others performances shows how great they both are.

Add in outstanding direction and the cherry is on the top.

"Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.

Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.

I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.

This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.

Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.

I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.

Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice. In two and a half hours ""The Dark Knight"" makes up for all the silly, offensive garbage adapted from comic books and graphic novels, and reveals just how much can be done with the characters and ideas in those books. This is finally a film that does justice to the Batman universe.",card hardi har har on the tabl go into the dark knight in imax i did not think christoph nolan wa a great director i wa not too taken by batman begin although it wa refresh after burton and schumach remind me of the lesser batman comic i have read and bizarr for noncomedi of the s televis seri and the film version of that except less fun i did not think heath ledger wa among the great actor of hi gener i did not think christian bale wa the best actor aliv and i wa not expect anyth more than an entertain batman movi despit be reassur by everyon i trust about movi that it wa much more have seen it a intend with the scene film specif for imax intact and cover the entir imax screen vertic i can safe say that the dark knight is without question the first time the batman charact and the mani great comic base in gotham citi have been done justic on film nolan version of batman is not meant to be realist it is meant to be plausibl and everyth here includ twofac feel plausibl still the film ha not forsaken it comic book root thi is not the watereddown batman of the s thi is the batman conceiv in the s and reborn in the s moment here thank to ledger astonishingli creepi and believ perform a the joker thi is the origin joker bank robber with no motiv massmurder with not a hint of merci not the ludicr clown jack nicholson horribl portray in burton effort recal the great batman book arkham asylum other recal the kill joke a anyon who ha read those book will testifi that is just about the highest prais i can give the portray of the joker here i do think that see thi in imax enhanc the experi although it is a littl annoy when the pictur clariti goe from a clear a possibl to clearli blownup when the scene switch from those shot on imax camera to those shot on regular film one can realli appreci the sound design here a well which is absolut remark all the way through thi is a far a im concern easili nolan best work a director hi handl of the film pace is absolut stun and the action here is both film and edit much better than in begin it is nolan work with actor that particularli impress with just about everi moment of act be superb here of cours michael cain and morgan freeman are phone it in but they dont exactli need to be brilliant here bale a well display littl depth a wayn but embodi all hi charm and make for an excel batman unless your percept of batman is a wisecrack fool then you might be disappoint no the act i refer to here is the extraordinari perform by ledger oldman and eckhart although ledger will sure get all the attent and he certainli great here i think that both oldman and eckhart stole the show a bit eckhart is better a dent than twofac but the transform is certainli not an easi task for ani actor maggi gyllenha is unquestion better a rachel daw than kati holm wa and nestor carbonel not an actor with much rang is realli veri good a the mayor of gotham citi over and over again film version of batman have disappoint ha the dark knight final got it right no doubt some will moan and complain about it not be distinct or styliz enough not captur the spirit of the comic guess what you have been read the wrong comic the best batman comic may not alway strive for plausibl but they are certainli far from the silli fun some might expect from the dark knight what you will get here is a ten dramat crime thriller with some breathtak action setpiec remark character the joker be given such a complex psycholog profil is a stun achiev and ledger is terrifi in the role you realli believ that he is danger and hi sick social experi are nervewrack to wit i have one or two misgiv about the dark knight i dont know if i would have handl rachel daw and harvey denttwofac the way the nolan brother do in thi screenplay but virtual the rest of the film is pitchperfect the pace is astonish i could hardli believ the film wa a long a it actual wa the act is phenomen the visual look of the film is right especi given the subtext nolan is go for here which youll see when youv seen the film the charact are rich the drama is real the action is spectacular and final the joker is given a definit portray tim burton onc said anyon who know me know i would never read a comic book for shame mr burton mayb if you had you could have made someth thi good the dark knight doe the charact of batman justic it doe the joker justic and it doe the great batman comic justic in two and a half hour the dark knight make up for all the silli offens garbag adapt from comic book and graphic novel and reveal just how much can be done with the charact and idea in those book thi is final a film that doe justic to the batman univers,Positive
"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding.

"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil. Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down. To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas. It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in.

"When Batman Begins was released in the year 2005, I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series, that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny, playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of Batman..

So when I went to watch this movie, I was ready to see the Heath Ledger's Joker cracking some jokes, blowing up lots of places, killing tons of people, going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..

Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work..

Other actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully.

"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it.

But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.

Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it.

But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film.

"A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling.

It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time.

Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic.

The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.

Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.

An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.

Superior to pretty much everything else.

"The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.

The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: ""I'm not wearing hockey pads!"" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed.

The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname ""the Dark Knight"" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.

It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the﻿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.

The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes.

"The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.

The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much ""face time"" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.

Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right.",the dark knight wa probabl the best action film ive ever seen not onli is the design tone special fx sound and music all were excel but the script wa den complex and thorough the perform from the actor were all veri good particularli ledger who took the joker into a realm of sociopath that weve not seen in a batman charact befor thi may be ledger best perform from hi all too short career the onli issu i have is the extrem gross and gori of the twofac make upspeci fx i think it goe a bit too far to have littl bit of flesh dangl from hi visibl bone structur the onli thing i believ that wa better from the previou bat man seri but the director doesnt use too much face time on that charact so the look remain shock and not overdon certainli the dark knight will stand out for quit some time a the best comic book movi a it ha that a it root howev it may also stand a a masterpiec in it own right,Neutral
"The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him, but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film; the camera-work was excellent, the pace was gripping, the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid. Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree.

All in all, a perfect film and magnificent acting...the film should have been named after the joker...Batman himself was not needed....such a Batman film will never again be produced, due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger.

"I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.

The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.

Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.

I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.

If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now.

You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it.

"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.

*Runs*

The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.

Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?

We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?

Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.

Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.

Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other.

"Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: ""If you only see one movie this summer, this is it"". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.

I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.

Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.

So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again.",rememb those say that magazin or critic would say one of the more popular one wa if you onli see one movi thi summer thi is it well until now i never understood that too well but now i realli realli do the dark knight is that movi a plain a i can say it the dark knight is by far the greatest most entertain movi releas all year period i had the privileg of see an advanc show for manag onli in imax about a week befor thi movi releas i wa ecstat that not onli wa i see thi much anticip movi a week earli but it wa my first imax experi if you have the option definit go with imax it wa unbeliev realli it felt like you were fli thru gotham citi about to fall into anoth scheme by the joker but enough about imax how about the movi well batman begin receiv exemplari rate from critic about an out of on imdb if i recal correctli a well sinc batman begin turn out so well and end with batman receiv word of the joker everi fan wa readi for thi movi asap just a short quick year later we final got the dark knight the main attract for thi show wa heath ledger part after hi sudden death some will be say that thi wa one of hi best perform and i can agre strongli the joker wa thrill yet comic heath brought out the dark villain even though he is well a joker all hi phrase and say made the movi what it wa but it still kept your mindset in fright mode veri hard to tackl look back on everi scene notic it wa hour and some odd minut i can not find a scene unnecessari few movi bare the except of be insan long but not at all bore and thi one fit that perfectli veri long veri detail but with patron pay that imax ticket price you want everi minut you can get i also could not find ani flaw realli with the movi except for the cast of maggi gyllenha anyon but kati holm wouldnt be good enough i mean maggi is pretti but not nearli a good look a kati holm sort of ruin her charact for me she is veri talent though absolut so after all wa said and done thi movi to me wa just about perfect out of christoph nolan absolut took batman to a new level and said forget the rest thi is top notch i want to watch it again,Neutral

"Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman).

This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.

A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨, ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part.

"The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot.

Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him.

My inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.

The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going.

As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be.",the dark knight is an intens power dramat and compel film but despit that im not sure i realli enjoy it a great deal i saw it on the huge imax screen in london which ha an abil to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film but at the same time variou aspect of the film meant that i felt alien from the charact and the plot who is batman and what do we realli know about him after have watch the whole film all hour of it im not sure i could say what are hi motiv doe he realli love rachel inde doe he have the capac to love at all again hint are given but the central charact is so poorli develop that it make it hard to realli care about what happen to him or those around him my inabl to empathis with the charact wasnt help by the ridicul number of subplot most of which are rush or incomplet and the relentless pace at which the film move from one to the other the film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storylin and develop the charact and theme within that the frenzi sequenc of larg unrel action setpiec whilst initi breathtak end up feel dull and predict what wa lack in between the explos wa anyth resembl meaning dialogu a few mumbl word from batman and some inan muse from the joker werent enough to keep the film go a such i left the film feel somewhat exhaust at the bleak joyless violent world i had wit and disappoint that thi muchhyp film just hadnt been a good a i wa hope it would be,Negative

However, sadly, the movie is depriving us of Joker because there are only like 5 scenes with him. Batman is pretty comedic in this movie. Which is not a good thing. He is always acting serious but his voice is just, how do I say this, cringe worthy.

"I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.

The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.

The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.

The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.

And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.

There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.

Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",i grew up on the anim seri love the first two batman film sort of like batman forev but disappoint in batman and robin i have yet to rewatch batman begin but i thoroughli enjoy thi film on rewatch have realli like it first time it is veri well made and grip with some great perform but person i would put casablanca wizard of oz amadeu and it a wonder life over thi the film doe suffer from be a littl too talki and the plot on occas can be hard to follow due to a lot go on nevertheless it is extrem good and not onli one of the better batman movi but also one of the better superhero movi visual and technic the film cannot be fault the cinematographi is superb and the spectacl of gotham citi is dazzl christoph nolan direct is taut and ensur that the action is explos the plot is a littl bloat with the joker bent on destroy organis crime for good and make batman cross between hero and vigilant and subplot about harvey dent and rachel daw and hong kong but there are some truli effect scene that are tightli structur and the screenplay in gener while a littl too talki in the first twenti minut is intellig and sophist the joker especi ha some veri sinist line that stay with you for a long while afterward the music by none other than maestro han zimmer who also compos music for the lion king gladiat and the pirat of the caribbean movi is outstand rous beauti haunt it is definit memor and doesnt becom forgett or gener like the music in the hurt locker for exampl and i have to say the sound engin here is phenomen particularli on veri high volum the explos sound veri authent a if they are come from outsid rather than from in the film and i have to mention the act a that wa terrif christian bale manag to be dark brood and charismat like batman should be though if i did have a complaint he doe speak in a veri hoar voic a if he got a sore throat and i somehow did not know what to make of it it wasnt irrit or anyth justodd anyway aaron eckhart is terrif a harvey denttwofac even if hi storylin wa a tad too rush and maggi gyllenha is veri sensit and care a rachel morgan freeman doe well in a smaller role a doe the excel gari oldman and michael cain is perfect a the loyal butler alfr there is no doubt in my mind that heath ledger gave the best perform of the film he wasnt just brilliant he wa phenomen unpredict insan extrem sinist and corrupt not to mention chillingli psychot i am torn on who i prefer over jack nicolson or heath ledger it is a veri close call i admit i am more familiar with nicolson portray and like hi mix of the scari and comic and even tragic joker but the joker here in the dark knight is truli sinist and even more of a threat to batman and in my opinion thi joker ha line that linger longer into the memori overal not absolut perfect but it is extrem good thank to primarili ledger perform and the dazzl visual spectacl bethani cox,Positive

"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight* is not just a superhero film; it is a gripping crime drama that transcends its genre to deliver a profound narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the human condition.

The film masterfully balances action with deep character development, showcasing Batman's struggle against not only external threats but also his internal demons. The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, particularly Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, which redefines the archetype of the villain. Ledger's Joker is chilling and chaotic, serving as the perfect foil to Batman's quest for justice.

Nolan's direction is taut, crafting a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The screenplay is sharp, blending intense action sequences with thought-provoking dialogue that raises significant ethical questions about the nature of heroism versus vigilantism.

The cinematography and score further elevate the film, with the haunting themes underscoring the emotional weight of the story. Each frame is meticulously crafted, contributing to an immersive experience that draws audiences into Gotham's dark underbelly.

Overall, *The Dark Knight* is a landmark in filmmaking that demands to be experienced. It is not only a thrilling ride filled with unforgettable moments but also a poignant exploration of the dichotomy between order and chaos, making it a film that resonates long after the credits roll.

"When I watched the dark knight for the first time, I was about 16 and I had mixed feelings towards it, I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer. Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after 'watching and having few knowledge' about some critically acclaimed films like ""the departed"", "" Inception "" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre .It was a game changer for my taste in films. It still tops the superhero genre even after 14 years of it's release. The only superhero/comic book film which comes close to this one is ""Logan"" in my opinion. So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of it's exploration towards many themes like human nature, dark reality of society, nature of lies, true and false characteristics and many more. Considering other parameters like cinematography, background score and screenplay, I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolan's films.

Easily one of the best comic book films ever made. Bale isn't great as Bruce/Bat but his acting is on par. However Heath's joker isn't an Oscar legend for no reason. One of the best portrayals of a character of l time.

"""The Dark Knight"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic success that transcends the superhero genre, leaving a lasting mark on the world of film. Nolan masterfully weaves a complex and morally ambiguous take of chaos and order, exploring the thin line between heroism and villainy. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is legendary! He is a force of nature and added layers of depth to the character. Heath Ledger steals every scene with a magnetic presence that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. Christopher Nolan's vision, coupled with Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance makes it an instant modern classic.",the dark knight isnt just a movi it a cinemat success that transcend the superhero genr leav a last mark on the world of film nolan master weav a complex and moral ambigu take of chao and order explor the thin line between heroism and villaini heath ledger portray of the joker is legendari he is a forc of natur and ad layer of depth to the charact heath ledger steal everi scene with a magnet presenc that is both terrifi and mesmer christoph nolan vision coupl with heath ledger unforgett perform make it an instant modern classic,Neutral

"Quite simply ""Dark Knight"" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a ""proper"" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).

Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't ""just"" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of ""dark"" and of perception of ""society."" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.

Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these ""abilities"" about him which are soooo unrealistic.

So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.

The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!

I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!

Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.

It's cool It's original It's awesome

I can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be.

"Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.

""The Dark Knight"" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from ""Prison Break"", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but ""sometimes the truth is not good enough"". My vote is nine.

"Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from cliché, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good.",write thi review at the tail end of open weekend the dark knight ha broken the record for open weekend and deservedli so thi film is a stepabov the standard summer blockbust howev the film also sit atop imdb top film of alltim list a rank that wont last nearli a long a it boxoffic rank line have been long to see thi film and mani of those who are vote on thi open weekend are diehard who wait in line and were readi to love thi film regardless of what it offer of cours the fact that thi film stand alon in it genr in term of write cinematographi art design and plot help boost it rate into the stratospher but when the non diehard begin to watch and vote well see thi film settl into it right place somewher in the top of all time it one of those few film that is entertain and access enough to plea the same peopl who went out in drove for spiderman while artist and smart enough to plea the more discern cinemat audienc truli disturb the charact were far from cliché a one would expect from the genr no charact is allgood or allbad ledger joker come close but earn a touch of sympathi none of the hero are flawless which is a sign of ani good film my singl complaint besid the variou hardtobeliev fall batman surviv is the rate thi film is fartoo disturb to garner a pg rate and deal with the ugliest side of human in a way that should probabl be accompani by a good convers that can add some perspect yet anoth reason whi thi film is so good,Negative
"And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like ""awesome"" and ""fantastic"" are thrown around way too much. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the plot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not in the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in almost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil.

The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace.

I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool.

I guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype. This is way more than a Batman movie or a summer blockbuster, it is just incredible.",and that word is awefantacul i use that word becaus word like awesom and fantast are thrown around way too much thi movi deserv better almost everyth about it wa perfect i will tri to give away a littl about the plot a possibl becaus to take away anyth from thi experi would be disastr let me just say that i wa not in the least disappoint with the plot it deliv in a mani way a seemingli possibl it improv on begin in almost everi way what you have seen in the trailer doesnt compar to what the movi deliv heard complaint about the run time but that wa absolut no problem for me everi minut of the movi wa great and i didnt think ani of it wa unnecessari at all in fact the onli real problem i had with the movi wa the dread of know that the movi had to end some time the movi wa the perfect mix of the human side and the action side it goe so much deeper than the battl against good and evil the act wa at the top of the rank christian bale ha onc again prove that he is made for the role of batman and bruce wayn maggi gyllenha serv a a great replac for kati holm a rachel daw morgan freeman and michael cain both play their role just a good a befor which is all anyon can realli ask is it not i think gari oldman wa even better a gordan than he wa in batman begin harvey dent wa play realli well by aaron eckhart a well but i guess in the end what peopl want to know is about is how the late heath ledger play the joker easili my favourit batman villain and mayb my favourit villain of all well he wa perfect i feel that the role will go down in histori a one of the greatest villain portray of all time give him the academi award and ani other award that he could possibl qualifi for hell invent a new categori just for him he wa the joker may he rest in peac i love the way the film wa shot whether it wa the hotel scene the scene of gotham citi and especi the action scene in the movi which i felt wa anoth improv made on batman begin i guess you could say it wa a lot more fun sinc a common complaint about begin wa the lack of that i thought the blue colour scheme of gotham wa realli great the movi also had some great wit throughout it which rare seem cheesi or out of place the score wa realli someth a well it is probabl one of my favourit one around one of the best thing about the film for me wa just how dark the movi wa if batman begin push batman and robin to the back of your mind then the dark knight will be the movi that push it out the film wa made to realli let the joker be what he wa truli meant to be without restraint i am amaz that it got away with the pg rate even though im an aussi and dont have that rate system the costum and makeup in the movi were big surpris just great i thought the joker makeup wa realli cool becaus it didnt just take the easi way out and make it perfect throughout the movi they went into detail with it batman new suit wa also pretti cool i guess in the end all i can realli say that i love thi movi and i think it would be hard for someon to be disappoint with it christoph nolan realli came through big time and made a massiv improv over the alreadi great batman begin thi is clearli a franchis that fit him like a glove it is suspens emot action pack and realli everyth el i think peopl could hope for a problem with the movi is that after see it you may just be a littl spoil becaus it is at a level of awefantacul that is pretti rare seen in movi believ the hype thi is way more than a batman movi or a summer blockbust it is just incred,Neutral
"First of all, no I don't think this movie is bad. But I don't think it should be thought of as the gold standart for comic book movies. Because honestly, this movie doesn't feel like a comic book.

This is a very good action movie, that dresses it's main protagonist and antagonist as comic book characters. And here I think lies the problem.

This is a movie about a billionaire, dressed as a bat, who beats an anarchist clown. And Christopher Nolan tries to make this look serious. I'm sorry, it doesn't work. It just takes away the comic book feeling. And therefore it becomes a little boring. If Heath Ledger isn't on the screen I find myself hardly invested in what's happening.

To be honest, I never really liked this movie that much. Maybe because I first watched when I was 8 and it felt boring. But I watched it a few times in later years and I still remember only pieces of fractions of what's happening, outside of scenes that have the Joker. And to be fair, I probably wouldn't have remembered those pieces, if I didn't watch reviews out of boredom.

I went online to see if there is anybody who feels the same way and they all said the same thing: Heath Ledger single handedly saves this movie. And while his performance is spectacular, I can't think of him as a definitive Joker. He is good for this movie, but I'm not sure if I can see him fit in other Batman movies. And a personal bias of mine is that no one is ever going to top Mark Hamill. However, Ledger did his own thing and he did good. Unlike other main charachters in the movie, this one won people over. But it's still in a movie that plays everything too serious.

It feels like Nolan took the main charachters from a comic book and put them in this, just because otherwise it would have been just another action movie. It lacks a certain element. It lacks that comic book campiness, that even the most serious comic books have a pinch of in them. And therefore it fails to deliver as a comic book movie.

That's not to say that being serious is a bad change. Too many comic book are corny as hell and very often it gets annoying. But if you get too serious, you get boring. One should not be at the expense of the other. One must find a balance between the comic book campiness and the seriousness of the real world.

To quote a certain character: Why so serious?",first of all no i dont think thi movi is bad but i dont think it should be thought of a the gold standart for comic book movi becaus honestli thi movi doesnt feel like a comic book thi is a veri good action movi that dress it main protagonist and antagonist a comic book charact and here i think lie the problem thi is a movi about a billionair dress a a bat who beat an anarchist clown and christoph nolan tri to make thi look seriou im sorri it doesnt work it just take away the comic book feel and therefor it becom a littl bore if heath ledger isnt on the screen i find myself hardli invest in what happen to be honest i never realli like thi movi that much mayb becaus i first watch when i wa and it felt bore but i watch it a few time in later year and i still rememb onli piec of fraction of what happen outsid of scene that have the joker and to be fair i probabl wouldnt have rememb those piec if i didnt watch review out of boredom i went onlin to see if there is anybodi who feel the same way and they all said the same thing heath ledger singl handedli save thi movi and while hi perform is spectacular i cant think of him a a definit joker he is good for thi movi but im not sure if i can see him fit in other batman movi and a person bia of mine is that no one is ever go to top mark hamil howev ledger did hi own thing and he did good unlik other main characht in the movi thi one won peopl over but it still in a movi that play everyth too seriou it feel like nolan took the main characht from a comic book and put them in thi just becaus otherwis it would have been just anoth action movi it lack a certain element it lack that comic book campi that even the most seriou comic book have a pinch of in them and therefor it fail to deliv a a comic book movi that not to say that be seriou is a bad chang too mani comic book are corni a hell and veri often it get annoy but if you get too seriou you get bore one should not be at the expens of the other one must find a balanc between the comic book campi and the serious of the real world to quot a certain charact whi so seriou,Positive
"The Dark Knight actually got lucky. Movies over the last six years have been crap. Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.

It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.

The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining. Besides, movies over the last few years are all dark - even the light-hearted ones.

"for weeks leading up to the film movie insiders have been claiming that not only is it the best batman movie but that heath ledger deserves a Oscar nod for his work as the joker here is my short take on the film sorry its 4am and i just got home. the film overall is about as good as its every going to get as a action film and as a film on its own i really do think as of what i have seen so far it deserves at least a Oscar nom for best film the acting alround is just top shelf stuff. i will say this the film felt abit long but it needed to be. OK on to the cast, batman from watching the trailers and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i was worried that batman would be pushed into the back....this is not the case. the film overall doesn't follow one person it follows the story and i think thats what makes it such a good movie cause in the end the story is the important part. OK my one knock on the film heath ledgers joker was good but i didn't think it was Oscar good, i will say he holds his own with jack's joker....actually i think its better but i don't think is Oscar good. i liked the way they used him in the film he pops in does the damage and pops out and it really works best that way. now Aaron Eckhart's two face/dent makes tommy lee's a joke....but really aaron take on both dent and twoface were amazing the characters are taken to deep levels and it really gave the film a extra kick and props to the special effects guys it looked so real. bale i think carries the story well just like in begins while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movie over all turns out better for it, and its not like he doesn't have his moments ether. Gyllenhaal replaces homes and honestly i would have rather homes im not saying she did a bad job i just think with home's work on thank you for smoking she would have been a better choice if they could of had her. or wanted her? finally the supports of freeman caine and oldmen work just as well as they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of his screen time overall its easy to say this is by far the best of the batman movies. if i had to compare it to anything its like saying batman begins is like a star war iv and D.K is like EP:v both are good but this one just takes it that next level up",for week lead up to the film movi insid have been claim that not onli is it the best batman movi but that heath ledger deserv a oscar nod for hi work a the joker here is my short take on the film sorri it am and i just got home the film overal is about a good a it everi go to get a a action film and a a film on it own i realli do think a of what i have seen so far it deserv at least a oscar nom for best film the act alround is just top shelf stuff i will say thi the film felt abit long but it need to be ok on to the cast batman from watch the trailer and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i wa worri that batman would be push into the backthi is not the case the film overal doesnt follow one person it follow the stori and i think that what make it such a good movi caus in the end the stori is the import part ok my one knock on the film heath ledger joker wa good but i didnt think it wa oscar good i will say he hold hi own with jack jokeractu i think it better but i dont think is oscar good i like the way they use him in the film he pop in doe the damag and pop out and it realli work best that way now aaron eckhart two faced make tommi lee a jokebut realli aaron take on both dent and twofac were amaz the charact are taken to deep level and it realli gave the film a extra kick and prop to the special effect guy it look so real bale i think carri the stori well just like in begin while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movi over all turn out better for it and it not like he doesnt have hi moment ether gyllenha replac home and honestli i would have rather home im not say she did a bad job i just think with home work on thank you for smoke she would have been a better choic if they could of had her or want her final the support of freeman cain and oldmen work just a well a they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of hi screen time overal it easi to say thi is by far the best of the batman movi if i had to compar it to anyth it like say batman begin is like a star war iv and dk is like epv both are good but thi one just take it that next level up,Positive

"I know it sounds a bit too cliché when someone says this, but this is undoubtedly one of, if not the best superhero movie ever created! It excels in every field it touches - The visual effects are done perfectly, the acting is absolutely Oscar worthy, the multiple storylines that don't seem too complex in spite of being told at the same time and in spite of being just one movie of a trilogy it managed to win the hearts of everyone who saw it.

The story picks up very well from where Batman Begins ended. The post credit scene in that movie had shown Joker, and I can very well imagine how excited the audience must have been seeing it. The Batman and Joker duo is used to describe the social aspects of the society, and explain how people might behave if they are left unhinged. A hero who has his moral codes and a lot to lose, compared to a villain without any moral codes and nothing to lose yet have so much in common than what meets the normal eye. Ultimately both are seen as freaks who must be eliminated by the law.

Let's talk about the characters, starting from Christian Bale's Batman. His voice sounds horrible as Batman. Nowadays many people have begun criticising it, but they don't realise that if a real Batman has to change his voice, he only has two ways of doing it - either using a voice modulator like Ben Affleck's Batman does, or deal with trying to sound different, which isn't easy when he has to breathe heavily because of how hard he works. It's just fun to see the caped crusader doing something on the screen.

Next let's address Michael Caine's Alfred. He's a good representation of Alfred. Just by looking at him you get the feeling of both a butler and a guardian, something we know Alfred to be. And it can be seen very nicely when he dresses Bruce's wounds or talks to him about his crimefighting.

Then we have Aaron Eckhart's Two Face. Unlike the previous iteration that was seen in Batman Forever, this one seems a lot more serious. He went through a hefty character development, from the patriotic white Knight of Gotham, Harvey Dent, to the deranged psychopath who is ready to cross all limits if he wants to have his revenge.

Jim Gordon is also a much, much better iteration from what we had seen in the 1989 Batman. He actually looks like someone who is invested in his job and can contact Batman whenever he needs help. He is the kind of Gordon I imagine when I think of the animated movies. When someone mentions Jim Gordon, this is the one who comes to my mind.

And finally the elephant in the room, the show stealer - Heath Ledger's Joker. Just like Two Face, Joker here has also gone through a complete makeover from what he was portrayed as in the previous movie that came in 1989. It's kinda sad that Heath Ledger never got to know how famous he has become, but his legacy shall forever live in the DC universe.

The Dark Knight is one movie I often come back to just to remember these kinds of superhero movies are also possible. Every DC character should be given such movies where their character is shown to develop as time moves on.

"The film was very disappointing. Firstly Heath Ledger, wow didn't see that coming. He was terrific. From A knights tale to the dark knight...... not the same actor surely. The tongue flicks and glaring at the camera were very real indeed. I am going to compare this to the 1989 film because in recent times that is the best comparison we can make. The 89 film was entertaining, this wasn't. It was too dark, too dreary and left me feeling a bit depressed which just isn't the aim of comics. Christian Bale's voice as Batman was ridiculous, I didn't have any empathy with his character at all, didn't feel for him.... just nothing. Thought that I wouldn't want to live in Gotham as it was so dreary and felt that Commissioner Gordon was just too earnest. Chris Nolan gave us the excellent Memento and I think another good film in Insomnia. Though I appreciate the lack of CGI (very refreshing) and the last half an hour of the film, i fidgeted throughout and by the end felt I could have left early. Last year the Bourne Ultimatum rattled along and I came out of the cinema entertained. This was just depressing. Can't understand why this is considered to be the third best film of all time on IMDb...... astounding.",the film wa veri disappoint firstli heath ledger wow didnt see that come he wa terrif from a knight tale to the dark knight not the same actor sure the tongu flick and glare at the camera were veri real inde i am go to compar thi to the film becaus in recent time that is the best comparison we can make the film wa entertain thi wasnt it wa too dark too dreari and left me feel a bit depress which just isnt the aim of comic christian bale voic a batman wa ridicul i didnt have ani empathi with hi charact at all didnt feel for him just noth thought that i wouldnt want to live in gotham a it wa so dreari and felt that commission gordon wa just too earnest chri nolan gave u the excel memento and i think anoth good film in insomnia though i appreci the lack of cgi veri refresh and the last half an hour of the film i fidget throughout and by the end felt i could have left earli last year the bourn ultimatum rattl along and i came out of the cinema entertain thi wa just depress cant understand whi thi is consid to be the third best film of all time on imdb astound,Neutral

"After defeating the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have little time to return to normal life. The mafia is growing, and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger, in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals, no goals, no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also, a love triangle forms between Wayne, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).

There's little use in writing a review of ""The Dark Knight"" -- the critics loved it, fans love it, the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it, too, making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck, even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor).

I could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The ""Bat-Sonar"" was far-fetched, cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting, encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So, there was room for perfection (which is why this film, as great as it is, cannot receive a perfect score).

Concerns aside, the film was well done, as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige""). The action is intense, the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense, plot twists, unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fiancé fairly fast). And Heath Ledger, oh my.

The hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric, declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However, the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker, inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but Ledger brings his ""A"" game. If he is nominated, I accept it; and if he wins, that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year, in any genre.

As I said in the beginning, my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true, but judging by the sales of the picture, you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't, see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly, depending on the special features).

"Normally I would give this a 7.5 out of 10 but since I cant' I'll give it a seven. How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDb.com is amazing to me. It's mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one, it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have rated.

A couple things I noticed when I watch this movie, the movie goes on way too long. Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans. There are about 3 or 4 points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another 30 minutes. And while Heath Ledger's performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly, his Batman persona is a bit weak. The voice is annoying, and many times throughout the movie, he seemingly plays second fiddle.

I can't know Eckhart's casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesn't seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candy.

There are many things I can harp about but I'm not here to knock the movie. There are good points, cinematography great, Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts, mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too long.

BUT this movie doesn't even belong in mention to some of the greats and shame on many movie fans that had this movie rated higher than such classics as The Godfather.

"What is going on with all of these maximum ratings for a barely average film? According to IMDb, this is the best film of the decade so far. Not one sane person could argue that this is justified. Have the studios finally managed to get the masses to 'believe the hype'? I was a bit skeptical about this film, due to the hype, and especially because I wasn't impressed with Batman Begins, but I must admit, the heist in the first five minutes was excellent, and I thought my skepticism was unwarranted. But then Batman turned up and began speaking like a wrestler with throat cancer, and it continued to go down hill from there. What I didn't expect this film to be was tedious. But it was. It was far too long and bored my pants off me. There was no character development, the story was convoluted and over-complex and it was far too long. But my my main problem, and this goes against nearly every reviewer here, even those who weren't impressed, I thought Heath Ledger was absolutely awful! Who are these people calling for a posthumous Oscar? There is nothing I despise more than a 'look at me' performance. Ledger did all the tricks required to portray a 'crazy guy', including shifting his eyes up, down, left and right at every opportunity, and ingeniously, due to having his mouth cut as a child, he keeps licking around the inside of his mouth, which rather than being an impressive feat of method acting is actually as irritating as watching a fat man eat chips with his mouth open. His performance was utterly self-indulgent and it seems like all you sycophants fell for it. The only decent acting performance in this film is Eckhart. Caine and Morgan bore, and Bale, with his 'employ me for movie trailers' voice barely has one dimension. I would have rated this film higher if it hadn't taken itself so seriously, but as it stands it is a pretentious hyped-up and tedious movie.

"Whatever else it may be, ""The Dark Knight,"" Christopher Nolan's follow up to his ""Batman Begins,"" the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It's full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and don't let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can't possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.

The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and it's through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger's creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He's not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.

I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and it's this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.

The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.

So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it's still, after all, a Batman movie, and it's not the best film since ""Citizen Kane.""

"This is the first movie sense The Lord of the Rings movies that had mad, crazy, super hype and surpassed it. I thought it was getting hyped up for the wrong reasons (the tragedy). I had my doubts going into this film because everyone was talking about the Ledger. After seeing so many previews, after seeing the film and knowing what other films the actor was in, he NAILED the Joker.

I was happy that the film had more to offer than the preview had shown. It had some unexpected moments (which was good) and everyone one, and I do mean, everyone to include the bit players were wonderful in this movie. Nolan commanded and got some of the best work out of these people. Christian Bale just cemented that he is either better but no less than at the same level as Keaton's Batman and in the way, director Nolan film is better because it's more raw than Tim Burton's Batman. It doesn't seem like some faraway city. Kudos also goes to the City of Chicago for allowing Nolan to do whatever he wanted, so we have a lot less blue screen (cgi) effects and more realistic action sequences.

But the man of the hour, is Heath Ledger. Like in so many movies where the villain steals the movie, this is no exception. You can see and sense the insanity in Ledger's Joker. I mean Jack Nicholson played Jack in the first Batman, but who would have expected this demented performance out of Ledger. And it was a great performance without the over the top, maniacal campiness that actors tend to do when playing villains.

Now the only thing I wasn't crazy about was Batman's voice, it sounded a bit fake and it was hard to hear at times because it was so low. But that didn't take ANYTHING at all, away from the movie. This is a must to see on the big screen. I think its a must to see on the big screen twice and it's a must purchase on blu-ray when it's release. The movie runs about 2 hours and 45 minutes so be sure to take your bathroom break before the film start because you will not want to miss a minute.

Director/Writer Christopher Nolan has that special film makers touch. He screwed with out Heads with Memento. He dazzled us with The Presitge (another movie with Bale in it). He reinvigorated us with Batman Begins and now he stuns us with the well-crafted ""Dark Knight"".

"I have enjoyed batman for a long time and despite my rabid fanaticism this movie took me to a whole new level. This is barely a superhero movie; it's utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all means. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the story, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledger's death which I feared might make the movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is a wonderful actress as Katie Holmes' replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was rather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the least, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for his performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own thespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined to have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You don't have to be a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless bubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid footing in this area.

"I have just returned from a premiere in Newcastle, Australia(15/7/08), let me just say this has to be one of the best movies of 2008.

This has to be scene on the big screen to be enjoyed, this is one of the very few sequels that is better than the original.

"Frank Miller's The Dark Knight was one of the greatest comic series ever made. I was a young comic book collector when it first came out and I remember buying 5 copies a couple of days after its release and then watching it sell out in a few weeks. The price for the first edition sky-rocketed after just a couple of months to over $100, as second and third runs were printed.

What Miller did was nothing short of revolutionary. He depicted the Batman much the same way as the original 1930s Batman comics did - as a nearly maniacal, shadowy vigilante who sets forth to strike fear into the hearts of villains throughout Gotham. But he deepened the internal conflicts, the personal relationships, and the psychological aspects of the stories - especially the 2-3 episodes that dealt with the Joker. Miller's Joker was the flip-side of the Batman. An entirely sociopathic force for chaos and evil - and not entirely unlike the Batman at a deep structural level - driven by a similar kind of megalomania. The commonalities between the characters were just enough to shake Bruce Wayne to his core and to cause him to question everything he stood for.

Take note - With Iron Man and this film, Comic Book Films Have finally begun to realize their full potential.

Thankfully, The Dark Knight took aspects of Miller's version of the Joker and brought them to the screen faithfully - with adequate but not overbearing special effects, great acting talent, and a script worthy of Miller's work.

The Joker, devastatingly played by Heath Ledger, is not the quirky Cesar Romero prankster, nor the slightly demonic Jack Nicholson Commodore of Crime, but rather Frank Miller's ingenious, amoral, homicidal maniac. And he is anything but funny. The Joker reigns terror down on Gotham through a series of increasingly murderous experiments designed to test his nihilistic hypothesis concerning human nature. The Batman is being hunted by a righteous new district attorney for his vigilante approach to justice, and it is becoming increasingly clear that crime has stepped up its skill and intelligence to meet him at his own level. Bruce Wayne, plagued by personal difficulties and the deep conflicts of his dual life considers hanging up his cloak just when Gotham needs him most. But something about the Joker gets way under his skin.

The film even captures Miller's dark aesthetic of Gotham and the Batman consistently. Ledger is perfect, Bale is very good (though he was not given the depth afforded the Joker by the script, the story dictates that this will change in the next film), and the excellent, star-studded, supporting cast makes this blockbuster worth seeing by just about anybody.

For those who know the story and bring great expectations to this film - you will be rewarded with catharsis. For those who don't - prepare to see something you would never expect from a comic book based film - intense psychological drama and powerfully realized characterization.For those who are just looking for a fun and entertaining action film - you will get more than you bargained for in The Dark Knight, but may find it too lengthy and dark for your tastes.",frank miller the dark knight wa one of the greatest comic seri ever made i wa a young comic book collector when it first came out and i rememb buy copi a coupl of day after it releas and then watch it sell out in a few week the price for the first edit skyrocket after just a coupl of month to over a second and third run were print what miller did wa noth short of revolutionari he depict the batman much the same way a the origin s batman comic did a a nearli maniac shadowi vigilant who set forth to strike fear into the heart of villain throughout gotham but he deepen the intern conflict the person relationship and the psycholog aspect of the stori especi the episod that dealt with the joker miller joker wa the flipsid of the batman an entir sociopath forc for chao and evil and not entir unlik the batman at a deep structur level driven by a similar kind of megalomania the common between the charact were just enough to shake bruce wayn to hi core and to caus him to question everyth he stood for take note with iron man and thi film comic book film have final begun to realiz their full potenti thank the dark knight took aspect of miller version of the joker and brought them to the screen faith with adequ but not overbear special effect great act talent and a script worthi of miller work the joker devastatingli play by heath ledger is not the quirki cesar romero prankster nor the slightli demon jack nicholson commodor of crime but rather frank miller ingeni amor homicid maniac and he is anyth but funni the joker reign terror down on gotham through a seri of increasingli murder experi design to test hi nihilist hypothesi concern human natur the batman is be hunt by a righteou new district attorney for hi vigilant approach to justic and it is becom increasingli clear that crime ha step up it skill and intellig to meet him at hi own level bruce wayn plagu by person difficulti and the deep conflict of hi dual life consid hang up hi cloak just when gotham need him most but someth about the joker get way under hi skin the film even captur miller dark aesthet of gotham and the batman consist ledger is perfect bale is veri good though he wa not given the depth afford the joker by the script the stori dictat that thi will chang in the next film and the excel starstud support cast make thi blockbust worth see by just about anybodi for those who know the stori and bring great expect to thi film you will be reward with catharsi for those who dont prepar to see someth you would never expect from a comic book base film intens psycholog drama and power realiz characterizationfor those who are just look for a fun and entertain action film you will get more than you bargain for in the dark knight but may find it too lengthi and dark for your tast,Positive
"""The Dark Knight"" is, without a doubt, a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's second installment in the Batman trilogy takes everything that made ""Batman Begins"" great and cranks it up to an entirely new level.

First and foremost, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. His performance is haunting, mesmerizing, and unforgettable. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, and his ability to channel the character's madness is truly remarkable. It's a performance that stands as one of the greatest in cinematic history.

Christian Bale continues to excel as Batman, bringing depth and complexity to the role. The film's exploration of Batman's moral dilemmas and the blurred lines between heroism and vigilantism add a layer of sophistication to the character.

The supporting cast, including Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, all deliver outstanding performances that contribute to the film's overall brilliance.

What sets ""The Dark Knight"" apart from other superhero movies is its gritty and realistic portrayal of Gotham City. Nolan's direction and use of practical effects create a visually stunning and immersive world that feels tangible and lived-in.

The film's themes of chaos, morality, and the consequences of one's actions are thought-provoking and add depth to the narrative. The moral dilemmas faced by the characters make for a compelling and complex story that keeps you engaged from start to finish.

Additionally, Hans Zimmer's score is pulse-pounding and adds to the tension and excitement of the film's action sequences.

""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a superhero movie; it's a dark and gripping crime drama that explores the darkest corners of the human psyche. It's a film that challenges the audience to think and leaves a lasting impact.

"""Batman: The Dark Knight"" is an absolute masterpiece that transcends the superhero genre and stands as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time.

One of the most remarkable aspects of this film is Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. Ledger's portrayal of the iconic villain is nothing short of mesmerizing. He completely disappears into the character, delivering a chilling and unforgettable performance. Ledger's Joker is chaotic, unpredictable, and utterly compelling. His every scene is a masterclass in acting, and it's no surprise that he posthumously won an Academy Award for his role.

Christian Bale continues to excel as Bruce Wayne/Batman. His brooding intensity and unwavering commitment to the role make him one of the most compelling Batman interpretations to date. Bale's dedication to his craft is evident in every scene, and he brings a complex depth to the character.

Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent/Two-Face is another standout performance. His transformation from a principled district attorney to a vengeful and disfigured villain is handled with nuance and skill. It's a tragic arc that adds emotional weight to the film.

The film's screenplay, penned by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan, is a triumph of storytelling. It weaves together multiple plot threads, themes of morality, chaos, and the nature of heroism, and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish. The dialogue is sharp and thought-provoking, and the pacing is impeccable.",batman the dark knight is an absolut masterpiec that transcend the superhero genr and stand a one of the greatest cinemat achiev of all time one of the most remark aspect of thi film is heath ledger perform a the joker ledger portray of the icon villain is noth short of mesmer he complet disappear into the charact deliv a chill and unforgett perform ledger joker is chaotic unpredict and utterli compel hi everi scene is a masterclass in act and it no surpris that he posthum won an academi award for hi role christian bale continu to excel a bruce waynebatman hi brood intens and unwav commit to the role make him one of the most compel batman interpret to date bale dedic to hi craft is evid in everi scene and he bring a complex depth to the charact aaron eckhart portray of harvey denttwofac is anoth standout perform hi transform from a principl district attorney to a veng and disfigur villain is handl with nuanc and skill it a tragic arc that add emot weight to the film the film screenplay pen by christoph nolan and hi brother jonathan nolan is a triumph of storytel it weav togeth multipl plot thread theme of moral chao and the natur of heroism and keep the audienc on the edg of their seat from start to finish the dialogu is sharp and thoughtprovok and the pace is impecc,Neutral

"OK, lets get it out of the way, I'm a massive Batman fan. I loved the TV show when I was a kid, really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions. I've even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels. I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one. So how come I've just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed? Why? Because this film just wasn't that good. It's far too long, has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously it's painful. The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought. The whole thing was one great, big, dreadful, noisy, mess. The only good thing in it is Heath Ledger's performance. I had my doubts when I first heard who'd they'd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath, he pulled it off. No thanks to the film however, which is so over cooked it's burnt. Sure there's loads of action, cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul. It was great looking but has no personality.

"It's a very soft 9, but it's a 9/10 for me.

Directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer - these guys are in their primes here. Not that the same isn't true of some of the actors involved in this film, Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart.

It's hard for me to do a review on this film and certainly the character of the late Heath Ledger is one of the greatest villains in cinema history. He is played to perfection. Perfect would even be putting it mildly. Ledger is so great in this film that all the awards and recognition he has received from around the world are too little.

Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Gary Oldman are all super, but the one who shines brightest out of the entire cast with the exception of Ledger is Aaron Eckhart and his character, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Christopher Nolan's hidden ace. A perfect addition to the film's story.

The action scenes are OK, the sound is good, the film is generally very good technically and is far from the most successful in the genre, but the acting, the pacing and the story itself make The Dark Knight (2008) the giant that it is.

I recommend it along with the other two installments in the series, ""Batman Begins"" (2005), and the not-so-good ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012).

Final score: 9/10.",it a veri soft but it a for me direct by christoph nolan and written by christoph nolan jonathan nolan and david s goyer these guy are in their prime here not that the same isnt true of some of the actor involv in thi film heath ledger and aaron eckhart it hard for me to do a review on thi film and certainli the charact of the late heath ledger is one of the greatest villain in cinema histori he is play to perfect perfect would even be put it mildli ledger is so great in thi film that all the award and recognit he ha receiv from around the world are too littl christian bale michael cain maggi gyllenha and gari oldman are all super but the one who shine brightest out of the entir cast with the except of ledger is aaron eckhart and hi charact harvey denttwo face christoph nolan hidden ace a perfect addit to the film stori the action scene are ok the sound is good the film is gener veri good technic and is far from the most success in the genr but the act the pace and the stori itself make the dark knight the giant that it is i recommend it along with the other two instal in the seri batman begin and the notsogood the dark knight rise final score,Neutral
"I've been waiting for this film since I had seen Batman Begins in the cinema three/four years ago, but I was disappointed that I did not see anything new. It also didn't help that the plot in the film was muddled up. There were different subplots happening in between the film and by the last half I was totally lost; even my boyfriend has fallen asleep. I didn't like Maggie Gyllenhal's role as Rachael - she was bland as a blank of wood/black tea with no sugar, *really* boring as an actress!

As usual, Bale puts on a great performance and I have always enjoyed the films he has been in from the past (Machinist, The Prestige, Equiliberium, Batman Begins, American Psycho). However, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne, I felt I hadn't seen anything fresh from his performance or, if there was, this was overshadowed by the film (I am sure he will make up for this in Terminator 4). I like Christopher Nolan as well as a director, but I think this film was all about money and not about quality film-making. Compare this film to Memento and The Prestige - the Dark Knight is nowhere near as good as those films. In other words, from the 'success' this film has made, it would look as though Nolan has sold out which is a real shame.

I have idea no where thes hype about this film has come from, but I suspect it is because of the fact that people have been defining this film as one of Heath Ledger's ""finest performance"". Sure, his role as the Joker worked well on screen, but, even so, it is not worthy of winning a BAFTA/Oscar for his performance. People have generously given this film either a 9/10 simply because they have bought the fascination surrounding Ledger's performance/death along with the excessive violence and not judging on this film, realistically.

This film is worth no more than a 6, I am afraid - it should NOT be in IMDb's top 10.

"In The Dark Night Movie, Joker in this movie is really a legend, He is my favorite Character in this movie, more then the Hero. The Hero is the Batmen but most famous character is the joker, the way he presents his character is mind blowing, i always gonna miss his acting, i wish he is alive so i can see him in more movies and more shades of characters.

"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" isn't merely a superhero movie; it's a magnum opus that redefines the genre. At its core is Heath Ledger's haunting portrayal of the Joker, a character study that delves into the darkest corners of human psyche. Ledger's performance is a revelation, crafting a Joker that is simultaneously terrifying and captivating.

Christian Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne is equally compelling, showcasing the internal struggle of a hero burdened by his sense of duty and the blurred line between justice and vengeance. The supporting cast, including Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman, deliver exceptional performances, adding layers of complexity to the narrative.

Nolan's direction is nothing short of genius, transforming Gotham City into a character itself-a gritty, sprawling urban landscape plagued by crime and corruption. The film's action sequences are meticulously choreographed, and the practical effects create a visceral sense of realism rarely seen in superhero films.

What sets ""The Dark Knight"" apart is its exploration of moral ambiguity and the choices that define us. The film raises profound questions about society, justice, and the nature of good and evil, challenging the audience's perceptions long after the credits roll. Hans Zimmer's score is the soul of the movie, underscoring the tension and emotion with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack.

In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that continues to captivate audiences worldwide. Its exceptional performances, intricate storytelling, and thought-provoking themes elevate it to the realm of timeless classics. A film that lingers in the mind and demands multiple viewings, ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a testament to the power of storytelling and remains an essential watch for anyone seeking profound cinematic experiences.",christoph nolan the dark knight isnt mere a superhero movi it a magnum opu that redefin the genr at it core is heath ledger haunt portray of the joker a charact studi that delv into the darkest corner of human psych ledger perform is a revel craft a joker that is simultan terrifi and captiv christian bale batmanbruc wayn is equal compel showcas the intern struggl of a hero burden by hi sen of duti and the blur line between justic and vengeanc the support cast includ aaron eckhart gari oldman and morgan freeman deliv except perform ad layer of complex to the narr nolan direct is noth short of geniu transform gotham citi into a charact itselfa gritti sprawl urban landscap plagu by crime and corrupt the film action sequenc are meticul choreograph and the practic effect creat a viscer sen of realism rare seen in superhero film what set the dark knight apart is it explor of moral ambigu and the choic that defin u the film rais profound question about societi justic and the natur of good and evil challeng the audienc percept long after the credit roll han zimmer score is the soul of the movi underscor the tension and emot with a hauntingli beauti soundtrack in conclus the dark knight is a cinemat triumph that continu to captiv audienc worldwid it except perform intric storytel and thoughtprovok theme elev it to the realm of timeless classic a film that linger in the mind and demand multipl view the dark knight stand a a testament to the power of storytel and remain an essenti watch for anyon seek profound cinemat experi,Neutral
This movie is only great because of Joker and Nolan's direction. Otherwise its a childish movie to me with lots of weak characters. There are many flaws in it as a movie as well.like shawshank and godfather i saw it many times but couldnt appreciate it that much.its the 3rd best movie of all time. I mean really? Joker no doubt is absolutely brilliant and fairly deserved an oscar but what about the rest ? He alone carries this movie along and others look petty and naive characters before him. Symbolically there is a continuous fight between good and evil in this movie but its an old theme now..,thi movi is onli great becaus of joker and nolan direct otherwis it a childish movi to me with lot of weak charact there are mani flaw in it a a movi a welllik shawshank and godfath i saw it mani time but couldnt appreci it that muchit the rd best movi of all time i mean realli joker no doubt is absolut brilliant and fairli deserv an oscar but what about the rest he alon carri thi movi along and other look petti and naiv charact befor him symbol there is a continu fight between good and evil in thi movi but it an old theme now,Positive
"I would say best film related to superhero, for was last film with popular superhero I was able to watch without getting bored. Now day most of the stories are dreadful. The screenplay, penned by Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan, is a triumph of storytelling. The film's plot is intricate and multi-layered, exploring themes of chaos, morality, and the nature of heroism. It challenges both its characters and the audience to grapple with difficult questions, making it a cerebral experience within the superhero genre.

"Remember when the joker explains why he uses a knife instead of a gun? He prefers to savour the little details, read between the lines, appreciate the moment. As opposed to a violent, quick thrill of a gun. For me this film ended up being more like a machine gun than a knife.

Let's start with the excellent aspects of this film. Strong performances - Bale is fantastic, Michael Caine and Morgan freeman always produce excellent performances and this again does not disappoint, Heath ledger is impeccable. Music score is incredible by Hans Zimmer. Cannot imagine a better soundtrack is possible for this film. Epic use of image, immersing cinematography, the make up and costume department need a raise.

What's a mixed bag and what's poor . The plot - the plot is decent, but far from outstanding. It's about half an hour too long. There's certainly one chapter too many. In the last 45 mins we have hospital gate and ferry gate. You really need to choose only one there. The ferry scene paints to us what the joker is trying to prove - that when it comes down to it everyone will become selfish, save themselves before others no matter the cost. However I don't think they quite hit the nail on the head with it. The way it pans out, for me, is too unrealistic. Call it my lack of faith in human nature. I feel a more believable scenario of human heroism would've sent a stronger message. Hospital gate provides very little to the plot, except 20 mins of watching a headache. Philosophical themes and execution - Heath Ledger's acting is incredible so don't come at me, but the joker is too one dimensional. I get it, he likes chaos, but I want more depth. It may be good enough for the comics but not for a film to the caliber of this one. There's just a little too much spoon feeding dialogue. All this talk about chaos and human nature. Allow the audience to read between the lines, decifer the deeper meanings for themselves. Be a knife, not a gun. Pacing - I can't really fault the pacing until it comes to Harvey's transformation into two face. This part of the film is really poor. Even when I watched this film as a kid I was like come on. It's not even a character arc , he more or less wakes up a sadistic maniac, like Peter Parker just wakes up as spider man. Im not saying two face is a bad character, but a substantially more amount of time is necessary for us as the audience to realistically believe this transformation from hero to villain. And lastly, the film is just a bit too crash bang wallop. Just turn the volume down a little bit.

Now, I admit this review focuses more on the bad than the good. I can only say that's because everyone rates this film so highly that I think the weaknesses are more relevant. It's a great film and I understand the hype. But we have to admit there are major flaws to this film. I hate the way people really brand the word about 'overrated' , I don't like using it - it makes you sound as a sort of Scrooge. However , with an IMDB rating of 9/10 I think there might be a strong case for it right here.",rememb when the joker explain whi he use a knife instead of a gun he prefer to savour the littl detail read between the line appreci the moment a oppos to a violent quick thrill of a gun for me thi film end up be more like a machin gun than a knife let start with the excel aspect of thi film strong perform bale is fantast michael cain and morgan freeman alway produc excel perform and thi again doe not disappoint heath ledger is impecc music score is incred by han zimmer cannot imagin a better soundtrack is possibl for thi film epic use of imag immers cinematographi the make up and costum depart need a rais what a mix bag and what poor the plot the plot is decent but far from outstand it about half an hour too long there certainli one chapter too mani in the last min we have hospit gate and ferri gate you realli need to choos onli one there the ferri scene paint to u what the joker is tri to prove that when it come down to it everyon will becom selfish save themselv befor other no matter the cost howev i dont think they quit hit the nail on the head with it the way it pan out for me is too unrealist call it my lack of faith in human natur i feel a more believ scenario of human heroism wouldv sent a stronger messag hospit gate provid veri littl to the plot except min of watch a headach philosoph theme and execut heath ledger act is incred so dont come at me but the joker is too one dimension i get it he like chao but i want more depth it may be good enough for the comic but not for a film to the calib of thi one there just a littl too much spoon feed dialogu all thi talk about chao and human natur allow the audienc to read between the line decif the deeper mean for themselv be a knife not a gun pace i cant realli fault the pace until it come to harvey transform into two face thi part of the film is realli poor even when i watch thi film a a kid i wa like come on it not even a charact arc he more or less wake up a sadist maniac like peter parker just wake up a spider man im not say two face is a bad charact but a substanti more amount of time is necessari for u a the audienc to realist believ thi transform from hero to villain and lastli the film is just a bit too crash bang wallop just turn the volum down a littl bit now i admit thi review focus more on the bad than the good i can onli say that becaus everyon rate thi film so highli that i think the weak are more relev it a great film and i understand the hype but we have to admit there are major flaw to thi film i hate the way peopl realli brand the word about overr i dont like use it it make you sound a a sort of scroog howev with an imdb rate of i think there might be a strong case for it right here,Positive
"The trick to these comic book superhero movies is not to take the source material too seriously. That's what made the original Batman from the 1980's, with Jack Nickolson as the Joker, work so well; everything about that movie, including all the main characters, was over the top, and rightfully so. We are, after all, talking about a man who goes out and fights crime while dressed up as a bat. How seriously, really, are we supposed to take such a notion? But this movie (among its various other flaws) takes itself WAY too seriously. It's supposed to be some deep, even epic, tale of, well, something. But, hey, if I want that, I could read Homer. Or Shakespeare. Or watch ""The Godfather"". Stories that truly are epic, in no small part because they feature real human characters, not ones that came out of a cartoon book.

That said, I can only review so much of this movie because, quite honestly, I don't remember all that much from it. Nothing about it truly stood out in my mind, other than that the general theme seemed to be to inflict upon the audience several scenes of considerable cruelty and sadism. And, unlike in other movies where these qualities played a significant role (Silence of the Lambs, Apocalypse Now), here these elements seem to exist solely for shock value, not because they actually add anything to our deeper understanding of the story.

Which brings us to the character of the Joker. Let me be blunt - Nickolson's Joker was at least ten times better than this one. Both are completely unbelievable, but Jack's Joker was at least interesting, even fun. He was a pleasure to watch in much the same way that a good James Bond villain is. But there is nothing pleasurable at all about Heath Ledger's Joker. First off, he is so psychotic that he couldn't function anywhere outside of an insane asylum; he kills off his own henchmen, burns their stolen money before their very eyes, yet this psycho somehow enlists a small army of loyal followers without giving them any reason to be loyal at all, and yet, despite being a complete walking mental meltdown, he manages to put in motion any number of very detailed terrorist plots that would require the exact opposite mindset, namely, one of cold and calculating rationality. In short, as a movie villain, he simply fails. Not only is he not credible at all, his sole contribution to the story is to add the aforementioned cruelty and sadism, making this not only a stupid and unbelievable movie, but a thoroughly depressing one as well. I mean, seriously. If you want to see movie characters who have a dark, twisted, and sadistic streak and yet come off as credible on the screen, one need look no further than such persons as Tommy from ""Goodfellas"" or Luca Brasi from ""The Godfather"". But the Joker from this film is just a void. Encountering his character was like stepping on a dog turd. The experience is wholly unpleasant and disgusting, but thankfully you forget about it pretty soon.

"This was a near-perfect masterpiece, it's what Marvel wishes it could do. The movie had tons of action scenes and a great storyline, it had the best Joker of all time. Ledger's approach to Joker wasn't the corny 1900s Joker, where he was making corny cartoon jokes. Ledger's joker was a psychological joker, that messed with people's minds and had them looking in every which direction. Bale was phenomenal, he was an incredible Bruce Wayne, was disappointed that the original Rachel dropped the movie though. It was an amazing experience to watch this movie. 10/10 would recommend anyone to watch this movie, if they would like to be entertained for 2.5 hours, it's worth it.

There is plenty of action with nice realistic combat scenes. The evil Joker is a solid opponent versus batman. I liked the psychological deepness that is showed in different stages inside the story. That makes the movie als interesting for more intelligent people.

"Oddly enough, I don't go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that it'll be over-hyped and bloated; that's just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy.

As I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledger's unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isn't just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeare's finest plays.

Let's first get to what I didn't like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movie's predecessor, Batman Begins. See, I've always thought the complex Batman character should be someone who's consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know he's got this secret identity thing going, and he doesn't tell people everything, and that's nice. Endearing, even. But Bale's inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that there's more than meets the eye. Bale's Batman doesn't feel like he's consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim.

Moving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because she's smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we don't see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday they'll get it right.

And then there's the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and it's like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart can't quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy who's better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dent's a noble crusader, the district attorney who's going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll who's there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, you'd think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesn't seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here.

The movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! It's not over yet! What will happen next? But surely there's a way to do this without producing a film that's two and a half hours long. If you're going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City.

But here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruce's conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because it's supposed to be gloomy ol' Gotham.

So for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. It's not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we don't even get clever plotting that we might expect from what's purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. There's much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - that's forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger.",oddli enough i dont go into a theater befor watch a blockbust movi with the

"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that transcends the superhero genre, delivering a dark and immersive experience that is nothing short of spectacular. From its gripping storyline to its impeccable cast, every element of this film contributes to its status as a modern masterpiece.

Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is iconic, a chilling and mesmerizing performance that stands as one of the greatest in cinematic history. Ledger's ability to embody the chaotic nature of the character brings an unparalleled depth to the film, making every scene with the Joker an edge-of-your-seat experience.

Christian Bale reprises his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, and his performance is equally compelling. Bale's nuanced portrayal captures the internal struggles of a hero burdened by the weight of his mission, adding a layer of humanity to the iconic figure.

Nolan's direction is nothing short of brilliant, crafting a Gotham City that feels both gritty and grandiose. The film's pacing is relentless, keeping audiences engaged from start to finish. The use of practical effects and minimal CGI enhances the film's realism, creating a Gotham that feels tangible and immersive.

The screenplay, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, weaves a complex narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the nature of heroism. The dialogue is sharp and thought-provoking, elevating the film beyond typical superhero fare.

Hans Zimmer's score is the heartbeat of ""The Dark Knight,"" intensifying every moment and contributing to the film's emotional depth. The iconic theme associated with the Joker adds an extra layer of unease, perfectly complementing Ledger's phenomenal performance.

In summary, ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic tour de force, a film that transcends its genre and stands as a testament to the artistic potential of superhero storytelling. Christopher Nolan's vision, combined with outstanding performances and technical prowess, has created a film that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the greatest of its time.",christoph nolan the dark knight is a cinemat triumph that transcend the superhero genr deliv a dark and immers experi that is noth short of spectacular from it grip storylin to it impecc cast everi element of thi film contribut to it statu a a modern masterpiec heath ledger portray of the joker is icon a chill and mesmer perform that stand a one of the greatest in cinemat histori ledger abil to embodi the chaotic natur of the charact bring an unparallel depth to the film make everi scene with the joker an edgeofyourseat experi christian bale repris hi role a batmanbruc wayn and hi perform is equal compel bale nuanc portray captur the intern struggl of a hero burden by the weight of hi mission ad a layer of human to the icon figur nolan direct is noth short of brilliant craft a gotham citi that feel both gritti and grandios the film pace is relentless keep audienc engag from start to finish the use of practic effect and minim cgi enhanc the film realism creat a gotham that feel tangibl and immers the screenplay cowritten by nolan and hi brother jonathan weav a complex narr that explor theme of moral chao and the natur of heroism the dialogu is sharp and thoughtprovok elev the film beyond typic superhero fare han zimmer score is the heartbeat of the dark knight intensifi everi moment and contribut to the film emot depth the icon theme associ with the joker add an extra layer of uneas perfectli complement ledger phenomen perform in summari the dark knight is a cinemat tour de forc a film that transcend it genr and stand a a testament to the artist potenti of superhero storytel christoph nolan vision combin with outstand perform and technic prowess ha creat a film that will undoubtedli be rememb a one of the greatest of it time,Positive
This Movie for sure made me see batman in a different light after all he is a human and has no super powers but it just shows that you don't need super powers to be a super hero.

"The world of superheroes has always been captivated by larger-than-life characters, but none have left as indelible a mark on pop culture as the iconic Dark Knight. Batman, a character beloved for his complex persona and thrilling adventures, has been brought to life in various mediums, but with the latest film, it's clear that the Caped Crusader has found a new home on the big screen. The 2023 Batman film, directed by visionary filmmaker David Fincher, is a visual masterpiece that brings this iconic character to life in ways that have never been seen before.

For someone like me, whose introduction to Batman came through animated series and comics, this film was a thrilling revelation. I was initially drawn to the character through the brilliant Batman: The Animated Series and various comic books. However, seeing Batman in a live-action setting, enhanced by state-of-the-art visual effects (VFX), was a game-changer. The film takes the character's appeal and magnifies it, creating a cinematic experience that is as thrilling as it is visually stunning.

The supporting cast is equally impressive. Selina Kyle, portrayed by a charismatic actress, embodies the complex and enigmatic Catwoman. Her chemistry with Batman is palpable, and their dynamic adds depth to the story. The film also introduces a formidable antagonist in the form of the Riddler, played by an actor who brings a chilling and intellectual malevolence to the character. The way the Riddler's elaborate puzzles and clues are woven into the narrative keeps the audience engaged in a thrilling and suspenseful mystery. Whether you're a long-time Batman aficionado or a newcomer to the world of Gotham City, this film is a must-see. Batman's legend has never shone brighter on the silver screen.",the world of superhero ha alway been captiv by largerthanlif charact but none have left a indel a mark on pop cultur a the icon dark knight batman a charact belov for hi complex persona and thrill adventur ha been brought to life in variou medium but with the latest film it clear that the cape crusad ha found a new home on the big screen the batman film direct by visionari filmmak david fincher is a visual masterpiec that bring thi icon charact to life in way that have never been seen befor for someon like me whose introduct to batman came through anim seri and comic thi film wa a thrill revel i wa initi drawn to the charact through the brilliant batman the anim seri and variou comic book howev see batman in a liveact set enhanc by stateoftheart visual effect vfx wa a gamechang the film take the charact appeal and magnifi it creat a cinemat experi that is a thrill a it is visual stun the support cast is equal impress selina kyle portray by a charismat actress embodi the complex and enigmat catwoman her chemistri with batman is palpabl and their dynam add depth to the stori the film also introduc a formid antagonist in the form of the riddler play by an actor who bring a chill and intellectu malevol to the charact the way the riddler elabor puzzl and clue are woven into the narr keep the audienc engag in a thrill and suspens mysteri whether your a longtim batman aficionado or a newcom to the world of gotham citi thi film is a mustse batman legend ha never shone brighter on the silver screen,Positive

"After reading quite a few reviews from the states i was very curious about this movie. As a kid i loved to read superhero comic books, spiderman and batman were my favourites. Loving the spiderman movies and also liking the first new Batman movie by Nolan and wanting to see the last performance by Heath Ledger i couldn't wait to see this movie.

Man was i disappointed.

Don't get me wrong, i liked the movie, i had fun with it and the performance bij Heath Ledger is something i will never forget. I was sceptical about him because people tend to exaggerate performances of popular dead actors but i must honestly admit, he blew me away. He also blew every actor away he shared screen time with, i liked gary oldman best together with him in a scene. I am still wowed by Hedgers performance, and i must admit i really feel frustrated that he is gone, this performance MUST get an Oscar.

Caine was very good, Bale was OK although i don't like him as batman, he is a good Bruce Wayne but not a good batman and i really enjoyed Aaron Eckart as Harvey Dent.

But i thought the movie also had quite a few flaws.

Without giving away too much i really though most of the combat action scenes were not easily watchable because they were to fast to follow, I really didn't like the way they went with two face, and the ending sequence with the bat and the joker to me was a let down. Also i don't like the way Nolan tells the story but i must admit, thats a personal opinion.

There were 2 surprising moments that i really loved, one containing a pencil which got me laughing very hard and the other the choice sequence which ended in a way i didn't see coming but loved it.

All in all, an OK superhero movie, 7 stars but 9? come on people, that's crazy.

It's unbelievable that movies like the matrix 1 , gladiator, as good as it gets, l.a. confidential, eternal sunshine and the spotless mind don't rank as high as this movie, i cant understand it although i respect it.

Happy to share my feel about this movie,

But I think it would be better if there was more scence of him in the movie.

", yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us.

"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy.

"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.

The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote.

"Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.

You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....

This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather.

"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace.

"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage.

"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film.

"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie.

"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.

Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.

Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.

And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.

The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made.",when i went to the cinema to see indiana jone i rememb see a trailer for the dark knight it wa dark full of explos and look realli cool be a huge fan of batman and the two burton film i couldnt wait to see it while i never saw it in cinema i rememb my friend tell me it wa amaz and one of the best film ever fast forward to when i final got to see the film and it wa a differ stori two and a half hour of the most pretenti bore and disappoint film i had ever seen let start with the plot basic the joker atleast that what they call him start kill peopl and caus mayhem mean batman ha to stop him sound simpl but the film spoil thi by have too mani plot line most of which have noth to do with the actual plot dont last long enough to be interest and could have been easili cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot now for the hero and villain batman is play by christian bale and come complet with an over the top gruff voic which sound like he smoke a entir packet of cigarett while do a cross countri marathon he nowher near a dark or a intimid a keaton batman and isnt veri engag a bruce either now for the reason the film is consid to be so great heath ledger a the joker ledger is the main drive point of the film and the most interest charact he play the role veri convincingli and ill admit is the best part of the film even though they could have call him anyth el instead of the joker and it would have been the same and that my biggest problem with thi film it doesnt feel like a batman film batman ha alway been a surreal franchis mean it walk on a line between the real world and a fantasi world whi doe gotham citi just look like and regular citi whi doe the joker not have ani comic death contrapt whi doe the batmobil look like a tank where are all batman uniqu gadget the problem is nolan doesnt understand that a man who dress up a a bat and fight crime cant be taken complet serious burton made a surreal world for batman and batman return creat a perfect environ for hi film but with nolan all i think of is just a crime drama with batman in it the joker could have been just a psycho with makeup the pace is also a flaw sometim the film move too quickli for u to digest what go on and other time it goe to slow that we lose interest onli reason peopl love it wa for heath ledger amaz perform and hi unfortun pas away befor the film releas and even that doesnt fit the bill for a batman movi to sum up the dark knight will go down in histori a the most overr film ever made,Negative
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'.",batman take on the crime lord with the help of lieuten jim gordon and district attorney harvey dent howev an even bigger evil rise to terror gotham maggi gyllenha is an improv over kati holm a rachel daw aaron eckhart add a good perform a harvey dent in the end thi is heath ledger movi he overpow everybodi hi earli death may have immort him but my opinion isnt inflat hi presenc is electr it help that hi charact is so ridicul crazi hi motiv ha noth to do with power or money which is so mundan he want chao and that is so much more fascin heath ledger make thi movi great and it surpass the seri reboot batman begin,Neutral
"I thought I was getting a clever comic book movie.

"I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.

This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.

I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).

There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.

I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst.",i will say up front that i have never seen a movi base on a comic book that i realli like except the anim one or the quasianim like _sin city_ you would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common but in the end theyr trade in differ kind of imag thi is basic just anoth batman movi same silli premis that a superrich hero battl over the shrink remnant of gotham citi villain with seemingli unlimit resourc in personnel and explos i will agre that heath ledger perform is amaz can thi be the same guy who play the gay cowboy in that other movi it is a real piti that he die i cant help but think that if he were still aliv and we were wonder what he would do next with hi great talent thi movi would not have an averag rate of a of thi write there are a lot of other fine actor morgan freeman and michael cain for cri out loud who are basic wast pretend to take their charact serious i did like the heist sequenc at the begin includ the joker first few line and the bit with the bu realli veri droll get your hope up but from then on it just a lot of peopl be blown up while the survivor emot angst dark brood comicbook angst,Neutral

"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.

As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.

The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.

Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.

As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN!

"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.

This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.

Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.

The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.

There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.

No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come.

"Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received.",heath ledger a the joker is brilliant and anytim he on the screen thi action film seem elev it also get the nihilist insan of the charact right a alfr michael cain so correctli put it some men just want to watch the world burn i wa less of a fan of christian bale perform a batman with hi toneless gruff voic and if im honest even the concept of the dark knight with batman san robin view a an evil vigilant by the citizen of gotham i also thought the film tri to pack too much in with the love interesttriangl maggi gyllenha rise of two face aaron eckhart and extran charact eg morgan freeman it could have also use a breather in between all the action scene though some of the element like that batpod with the extra fat tire were pretti cool it goe on way too long at minut and if it had been pare down and more focus on the joker sadist psycholog cruelti could have been a masterpiec all in all it a good entertain film but not worthi of the extraordinari high prais and rate it receiv,Positive
"In my opinion, this movie a bit over-hyped and a bit over-rated actually. Is this movie better than 12 Angry Men or Schindler's List or The Return Of The King? Absoulutely not. Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted. This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger.

"There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.

A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!

The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?

Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.

The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.

Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.

Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!

Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.

As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!",there is just one thing that differenti a legend from ordinari man it hi fight with inner demon to over come all hi fear that defin a legend and thi is what batman stand for batman is not just anoth comic charact but it a complet saga of how you stand tall in spite of lose everyth walk fearlessli even when you are lone and how you fight back against all odd and over shadow your own fear fear the most domin emot mankind ha ever wit batman is no except he still ha fear he still get scare of lose those who are close to him and he is still in doubt when it come to decis but what is interest and inspir about batman is that he ha the abil to use wise the biggest and most danger weapon of all time perfectli brain that whi he is my favourit comic charact and thi time batman is put everyth on the line to save the world from out of control freak the joker a spell bound perform by heath ledger a the joker though he is no more with u but hi immort act a joker is an oscar win perform and will alway be rememb your heart come out to mouth to see the horror joker creat in start i wa bit confus a hi perform remind me of jack nicholson from the first batman movi but later i realis that thi is for real he did not imit jack but showcas the true and horribl side of a real joker the best part about heath is that he display the flip side of a joker fearless there are mani time when we feel that some one could have done better with certain role but not here here heath is perfect a a joker and from now on i will call him heath joker ledger the stori is about a terror that ha shaken the underworld of gotham the fear of batman is get in to crimin mind and all of them are now think where their money can be save from batman reach and that where the joker come with a plan to these crimin kill batman now with hi pervert mind the joker is behind batman life and what follow is a scari hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith v courag at one end joker ha no fear and on the other batman ha a respons of save gotham now the import question is that who will win and more than that at what cost apart from break box offic record thi movi is also abl to break the pattern of film make batman seri is an action seri when you make an action movi you give the requir pace in a movi by focus on elabor the action scene but here the director build the movi with a mix of action a well a other emot scene step by step movi give it audienc action and emot at the time when it requir but with an unexpect style dark intens and a complet batman style the batman movi are famou for it back ground music and the dark knight is no except special when there is sound of a whistl in background of some intens scene in the movi i felt a rush in to my blood and boil my brain my eye pop out while watch those scene to mention batman grill session with the joker is a masterpiec the scene wa simpli awesom mainli coz of background music harvey dent charact could have been better post he becom face i wa expect hi charact to be more involv and longer in the seri rachel daw is also a veri strong influenc charact in the movi her involv in the movi is much focus than kati holm in batman begin but the point im make here is the glam factor in thi movi she wa not given that much footag in a glamor way nevertheless the plot did not allow audienc to think that way either action scene in thi movi are well thought of and will chill the audienc spinal chord my favourit is the chase scene where joker is tri best to catch harvey dent and how batman come in between thi is where batman say asta la vista and welcom hi new girl friend hi damn new bike it call batpod i can imagin how excit you will be when you know that batman is now go to catch the joker and joker is happi that batman ha miss hi shot thi is sheer delight to watch the creativ involv of special effect blend with brilliant cinematographi unlik other hollywood flick the dark knight is a lengthi movi of more than ½ hr of nonstop adrenalin but you wont mind spend that much time watch it mani time we feel that some movi couldv been shorter and some lengthier but with the dark knight that not the case it mainli becaus the movi end up at the time when it is requir to scroll the curtain down i wa so satisfi while come out from the movi hall perfect end well the dark knight is just a begin now im expect the penguin and the riddler to come in to the pictur and take thi battl ahead a i said earlier im a big fan of batman and after thi movi im mad about not just batman but each and everi part of hi movi music and the joker now while im rush straight to the nearest movi store to buy all origin movi and soundtrack of batman seri you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the joker or batman choic is your,Positive

"Today, its ranking is #1 out of top 250 movies of all times. That is absurd. This movie is great - but by no means best movie ever. It is not a movie that revolutionizes movies as we see them. It is hard for me to imagine why someone would think this movie is better than breakthroughs like The godfather, Pulp fiction, Matrix, etc. I loved the movie - but nothing in the movie was revolutionary. The story line was not extra-ordinary. The gadgets were great but we have seen better. (sweet tires on the bat mobile + bike). Acting was great. By all means worthwhile of watching - but I am actually very disappointed to see it at #1 movie of all times",today it rank is out of top movi of all time that is absurd thi movi is great but by no mean best movi ever it is not a movi that revolution movi a we see them it is hard for me to imagin whi someon would think thi movi is better than breakthrough like the godfath pulp fiction matrix etc i love the movi but noth in the movi wa revolutionari the stori line wa not extraordinari the gadget were great but we have seen better sweet tire on the bat mobil bike act wa great by all mean worthwhil of watch but i am actual veri disappoint to see it at movi of all time,Neutral
"Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.

Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.

I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.

This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.

Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.

I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.

Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice. In two and a half hours ""The Dark Knight"" makes up for all the silly, offensive garbage adapted from comic books and graphic novels, and reveals just how much can be done with the characters and ideas in those books. This is finally a film that does justice to the Batman universe.",card hardi har har on the tabl go into the dark knight in imax i did not think christoph nolan wa a great director i wa not too taken by batman begin although it wa refresh after burton and schumach remind me of the lesser batman comic i have read and bizarr for noncomedi of the s televis seri and the film version of that except less fun i did not think heath ledger wa among the great actor of hi gener i did not think christian bale wa the best actor aliv and i wa not expect anyth more than an entertain batman movi despit be reassur by everyon i trust about movi that it wa much more have seen it a intend with the scene film specif for imax intact and cover the entir imax screen vertic i can safe say that the dark knight is without question the first time the batman charact and the mani great comic base in gotham citi have been done justic on film nolan version of batman is not meant to be realist it is meant to be plausibl and everyth here includ twofac feel plausibl still the film ha not forsaken it comic book root thi is not the watereddown batman of the s thi is the batman conceiv in the s and reborn in the s moment here thank to ledger astonishingli creepi and believ perform a the joker thi is the origin joker bank robber with no motiv massmurder with not a hint of merci not the ludicr clown jack nicholson horribl portray in burton effort recal the great batman book arkham asylum other recal the kill joke a anyon who ha read those book will testifi that is just about the highest prais i can give the portray of the joker here i do think that see thi in imax enhanc the experi although it is a littl annoy when the pictur clariti goe from a clear a possibl to clearli blownup when the scene switch from those shot on imax camera to those shot on regular film one can realli appreci the sound design here a well which is absolut remark all the way through thi is a far a im concern easili nolan best work a director hi handl of the film pace is absolut stun and the action here is both film and edit much better than in begin it is nolan work with actor that particularli impress with just about everi moment of act be superb here of cours michael cain and morgan freeman are phone it in but they dont exactli need to be brilliant here bale a well display littl depth a wayn but embodi all hi charm and make for an excel batman unless your percept of batman is a wisecrack fool then you might be disappoint no the act i refer to here is the extraordinari perform by ledger oldman and eckhart although ledger will sure get all the attent and he certainli great here i think that both oldman and eckhart stole the show a bit eckhart is better a dent than twofac but the transform is certainli not an easi task for ani actor maggi gyllenha is unquestion better a rachel daw than kati holm wa and nestor carbonel not an actor with much rang is realli veri good a the mayor of gotham citi over and over again film version of batman have disappoint ha the dark knight final got it right no doubt some will moan and complain about it not be distinct or styliz enough not captur the spirit of the comic guess what you have been read the wrong comic the best batman comic may not alway strive for plausibl but they are certainli far from the silli fun some might expect from the dark knight what you will get here is a ten dramat crime thriller with some breathtak action setpiec remark character the joker be given such a complex psycholog profil is a stun achiev and ledger is terrifi in the role you realli believ that he is danger and hi sick social experi are nervewrack to wit i have one or two misgiv about the dark knight i dont know if i would have handl rachel daw and harvey denttwofac the way the nolan brother do in thi screenplay but virtual the rest of the film is pitchperfect the pace is astonish i could hardli believ the film wa a long a it actual wa the act is phenomen the visual look of the film is right especi given the subtext nolan is go for here which youll see when youv seen the film the charact are rich the drama is real the action is spectacular and final the joker is given a definit portray tim burton onc said anyon who know me know i would never read a comic book for shame mr burton mayb if you had you could have made someth thi good the dark knight doe the charact of batman justic it doe the joker justic and it doe the great batman comic justic in two and a half hour the dark knight make up for all the silli offens garbag adapt from comic book and graphic novel and reveal just how much can be done with the charact and idea in those book thi is final a film that doe justic to the batman univers,Positive
"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all.",it is odd to spend more than two hour watch a film and it slowli dawn on you that you are not particularli bother how it end and if anyth rather wish it would end sooner rather than later the dark knight is that kind of film exactli whi i lost interest or even when im not too sure but lose interest i did thi is christoph nolan second stab at batman a well a christian rant bale and although all the element are there it is simpli not a good natur thi be anoth slug blast and punchfest tho despit it reput for be dark thank not a bloodfest mani mani viewer have laud thi a a masterpiec the best movi of so far far surpass begin no it isnt and no it doesnt all i can say is that these peopl have not seen mani masterpiec or mani film in the dark knight in that way which hollywood ha made it sugari own attempt to flatter the audienc by includ a moral dilemma and it doe so not onc but rather often thi time we are invit the we be the popcornchew saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxuri to reflect on moral ambigu and how rel rather than absolut the notion of good and evil can be and each time thi viewer sigh a littl a the say goe you can put lipstick on a pig but it is still a pig we get ani number of high falutin speech about hero and villain but in truth is just so much codswallop in truth thi film is just anoth blockbust and at that it is not even a good a mani other blockbust if you want to medit on the realiti of good and evil of hero and villain by all mean make a film do so but in the dark knight it is all for thi viewer at least all veri phoney apart from that thi film is a tad confus there are too mani charact the plot or at least what there is of it realli doe not bear repeat the suspens is curious unexcit and too often the film drag the old actor are there and all with the veri honour except of the late heath ledger seem to be act by number thi wa i think ledger last film and hi earli death is sad undoubtedli he wa veri talent and have said all that there is not much more to say it not bad it not particularli good a part of the seri it stand tall but then the seri is not all that outstand see it if you want to and if after read thi you decid not to well sorri but you wont be miss much at all,Neutral

"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil. Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down. To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas. It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in.

"When Batman Begins was released in the year 2005, I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series, that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny, playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of Batman..

So when I went to watch this movie, I was ready to see the Heath Ledger's Joker cracking some jokes, blowing up lots of places, killing tons of people, going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..

Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work..

Other actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully.

This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, For those of you who haven't watched it yet, I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely..",when batman begin wa releas in the year i watch it and wonder see the end scene where the joker wa reveal to be the villain in the next instal of the seri that well how christoph nolan is gonna incorpor the funni play and complet insan charact of the joker in to hi dark and seriou version of batman so when i went to watch thi movi i wa readi to see the heath ledger joker crack some joke blow up lot of place kill ton of peopl go way beyond insan and of cours laugh a lot but the joker i saw wa rather just the opposit he did blow up build he did kill peopl he did go insan and laugh but he did all of thi with a motiv and a touch of control and calm to it it been a while sinc i have seen a movi where the villain shine more than the hero and in thi movi heath ledger joker complet stole the show everyth he doe seem reason and the thing that he say feel honest and true the movi grip you throughout it min runtim christoph nolan nail it and show how comic book charact can be taken out of their color world put in a dark and seriou movi and make it work other actor also play their part well christian bale wa good a batmanbruc wayn aaron eckhart wa brilliant a harvey dent gari oldman maggi gyllenha michael cain and morgan freeman play their role beauti thi movi is one of my favorit movi of all time for those of you who havent watch it yet i recommend you watch it a soon a possibl becaus thi kind of gem come rare,Positive

"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it.

But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.

Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it.

"A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling.

It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time.

Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic.

The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.

Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.

An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.

"The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.

The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: ""I'm not wearing hockey pads!"" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed.

The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname ""the Dark Knight"" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.

It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the﻿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.

The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes.

"The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.

The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much ""face time"" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.

Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right.",the dark knight wa probabl the best action film ive ever seen not onli is the design tone special fx sound and music all were excel but the script wa den complex and thorough the perform from the actor were all veri good particularli ledger who took the joker into a realm of sociopath that weve not seen in a batman charact befor thi may be ledger best perform from hi all too short career the onli issu i have is the extrem gross and gori of the twofac make upspeci fx i think it goe a bit too far to have littl bit of flesh dangl from hi visibl bone structur the onli thing i believ that wa better from the previou bat man seri but the director doesnt use too much face time on that charact so the look remain shock and not overdon certainli the dark knight will stand out for quit some time a the best comic book movi a it ha that a it root howev it may also stand a a masterpiec in it own right,Neutral
"The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him, but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film; the camera-work was excellent, the pace was gripping, the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid. Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree.

All in all, a perfect film and magnificent acting...the film should have been named after the joker...Batman himself was not needed....such a Batman film will never again be produced, due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger.

"I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.

The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.

Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.

I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.

If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now.

"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.

*Runs*

The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.

Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?

We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?

Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.

Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.

Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven.",i have the flame suit on ive alreadi call my lawyer ive prepar fake passport and bought sever differ alias to run by i have also transfer my fund to a european account whi so seriou becaus here we go the dark knight is not the epic piec of godli art that everyon is hype it to be run the dark knight is a good piec of work a decent movi but doe not fall into nearperfect by ani mean despit the amaz perform write and action sequenc the heart and core of the comic book flavor is sever miss issu from batman begin is carri over and repeat here even though they arent a easi to spot thi is much better than begin but still fail to total era the memori of burton vision of batman resembl more the godfath and heat rather than a flick like iron man or spiderman it a total differ sort of movi involv superhero and supervillian gotham citi still doesnt truli look like gotham citi start the movi is a bank robberi unlik ani other set the tone of the movi instantli we see the joker heath ledger stir some earli troubl with the mob and crime lord we then see batman imit lurk about last but not least we see bruce wayn ex maggi gyllenha around the arm of anoth man harvey dent aaron eckhart then run amok throughout the minut of the dark knight are action sequenc plot twist sever surpris sever close call and a whole lot of crime drama good v evil is a battl that is horrif blur and human natur surround gotham citi is be test all the tension is overcom bruce wayn and batman and he begin question hi motiv and placement within the citi the write staff threw in plenti of deep and engag dialogu amongst all the action we see onscreen it a batman fan dream come true or is it we can start by credit heath ledger for a fine perform a the joker but if ledger deserv an oscar for hi role so should nicholson back in becaus believ there are mani similar in term of perform the joker here is cynic merciless and is bent on anarchi for no reasonbut so wa joker in if ledger win the oscar then jack himself should be accept it on hi behalf christian bale yet again fail a batman with hi frustrat raspi voic a bruce wayn he nail it but a batman he still need a bit of work when batman start monolog it hard not to cring the rest of the cast doe a good job most notabl gari oldman a lt gordon let also not forget morgan freedman michael cain aaron eckhart and maggi gyllenha the biggest strength of the batman univers lie within the balanc of batman and hi villain almost all of them have some sort of connect with our hero howev the treatment of villain yet again is disappoint a we see a few villain limit to mere cameo and the joker himself despit the trailer doe not get a much screen time a you may assum in the infam version we saw the joker rise from lowli punk crimin to a seriou threat to the entir citi in the dark knight unlik batman there is liter no explan a to whi he is the way he is there is no backstori reveal noth that could possibl explain hi physic appear and mental state sure he may craft some tale but whi believ a madman tale a he wield a knife to your lip dark knight best moment were not the action sequenc but the immens tension and suspens predat the payoff rare could you predict the outcom of some of the conflict and for the most part all the payoff were grand sometim lead to applaus the chase and actionpack moment themselv were also wellcraft and made great use of special effect yet with so mani problem fli at you at the same time it imposs to expect them all to be conclud and wrap up in the end nolan direct is stun from time to time but then he run out of steam toward the end of the third act when the movi is almost finish the end albeit unexpect wa a bit underwhelm and quit vagu especi consid the fact that the dark knight is minut long bottom line the neg is sprinkl about in thi review but dont let that fool you the dark knight is inde a great blockbust flick that will have you forget that there popcorn and soda by your side from the dazzl perform of the late heath ledger to the carefullyconstruct action sequenc that keep the pace flow there is plenti to prais about that be said it still not the best superhero movi of alltim batman is a comic book and the cast of thi new franchis must rememb thi you can dwell a much realism a youd like but the fact remain that thi isnt a realist franchis nor should it ever be treat a such gotham citi is still miss it gritti gothic dark architectur and style of burton film and need more emphasi on the villain that are in batman world the villain are the yang to the batman mytholog and batman himself is the yin you cant have too much of one and not enough of the other while it isnt batman and robin or fantast four both of them the dark knight still fall short of masterpiec qualiti simpli becaus of it exchang of comic book style for realist crime drama the dark knight is a great ride but not an epic one to qualiti heaven,Positive
"Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: ""If you only see one movie this summer, this is it"". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.

I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.

Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.

So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again.",rememb those say that magazin or critic would say one of the more popular one wa if you onli see one movi thi summer thi is it well until now i never understood that too well but now i realli realli do the dark knight is that movi a plain a i can say it the dark knight is by far the greatest most entertain movi releas all year period i had the privileg of see an advanc show for manag onli in imax about a week befor thi movi releas i wa ecstat that not onli wa i see thi much anticip movi a week earli but it wa my first imax experi if you have the option definit go with imax it wa unbeliev realli it felt like you were fli thru gotham citi about to fall into anoth scheme by the joker but enough about imax how about the movi well batman begin receiv exemplari rate from critic about an out of on imdb if i recal correctli a well sinc batman begin turn out so well and end with batman receiv word of the joker everi fan wa readi for thi movi asap just a short quick year later we final got the dark knight the main attract for thi show wa heath ledger part after hi sudden death some will be say that thi wa one of hi best perform and i can agre strongli the joker wa thrill yet comic heath brought out the dark villain even though he is well a joker all hi phrase and say made the movi what it wa but it still kept your mindset in fright mode veri hard to tackl look back on everi scene notic it wa hour and some odd minut i can not find a scene unnecessari few movi bare the except of be insan long but not at all bore and thi one fit that perfectli veri long veri detail but with patron pay that imax ticket price you want everi minut you can get i also could not find ani flaw realli with the movi except for the cast of maggi gyllenha anyon but kati holm wouldnt be good enough i mean maggi is pretti but not nearli a good look a kati holm sort of ruin her charact for me she is veri talent though absolut so after all wa said and done thi movi to me wa just about perfect out of christoph nolan absolut took batman to a new level and said forget the rest thi is top notch i want to watch it again,Neutral

"Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman).

This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.

A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨, ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part.

"The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot.

Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him.

My inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.

The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going.

As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be.",the dark knight is an intens power dramat and compel film but despit that im not sure i realli enjoy it a great deal i saw it on the huge imax screen in london which ha an abil to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film but at the same time variou aspect of the film meant that i felt alien from the charact and the plot who is batman and what do we realli know about him after have watch the whole film all hour of it im not sure i could say what are hi motiv doe he realli love rachel inde doe he have the capac to love at all again hint are given but the central charact is so poorli develop that it make it hard to realli care about what happen to him or those around him my inabl to empathis with the charact wasnt help by the ridicul number of subplot most of which are rush or incomplet and the relentless pace at which the film move from one to the other the film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storylin and develop the charact and theme within that the frenzi sequenc of larg unrel action setpiec whilst initi breathtak end up feel dull and predict what wa lack in between the explos wa anyth resembl meaning dialogu a few mumbl word from batman and some inan muse from the joker werent enough to keep the film go a such i left the film feel somewhat exhaust at the bleak joyless violent world i had wit and disappoint that thi muchhyp film just hadnt been a good a i wa hope it would be,Negative

"I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.

The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.

The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.

The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.

And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.

There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.

Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",i grew up on the anim seri love the first two batman film sort of like batman forev but disappoint in batman and robin i have yet to rewatch batman begin but i thoroughli enjoy thi film on rewatch have realli like it first time it is veri well made and grip with some great perform but person i would put casablanca wizard of oz amadeu and it a wonder life over thi the film doe suffer from be a littl too talki and the plot on occas can be hard to follow due to a lot go on nevertheless it is extrem good and not onli one of the better batman movi but also one of the better superhero movi visual and technic the film cannot be fault the cinematographi is superb and the spectacl of gotham citi is dazzl christoph nolan direct is taut and ensur that the action is explos the plot is a littl bloat with the joker bent on destroy organis crime for good and make batman cross between hero and vigilant and subplot about harvey dent and rachel daw and hong kong but there are some truli effect scene that are tightli structur and the screenplay in gener while a littl too talki in the first twenti minut is intellig and sophist the joker especi ha some veri sinist line that stay with you for a long while afterward the music by none other than maestro han zimmer who also compos music for the lion king gladiat and the pirat of the caribbean movi is outstand rous beauti haunt it is definit memor and doesnt becom forgett or gener like the music in the hurt locker for exampl and i have to say the sound engin here is phenomen particularli on veri high volum the explos sound veri authent a if they are come from outsid rather than from in the film and i have to mention the act a that wa terrif christian bale manag to be dark brood and charismat like batman should be though if i did have a complaint he doe speak in a veri hoar voic a if he got a sore throat and i somehow did not know what to make of it it wasnt irrit or anyth justodd anyway aaron eckhart is terrif a harvey denttwofac even if hi storylin wa a tad too rush and maggi gyllenha is veri sensit and care a rachel morgan freeman doe well in a smaller role a doe the excel gari oldman and michael cain is perfect a the loyal butler alfr there is no doubt in my mind that heath ledger gave the best perform of the film he wasnt just brilliant he wa phenomen unpredict insan extrem sinist and corrupt not to mention chillingli psychot i am torn on who i prefer over jack nicolson or heath ledger it is a veri close call i admit i am more familiar with nicolson portray and like hi mix of the scari and comic and even tragic joker but the joker here in the dark knight is truli sinist and even more of a threat to batman and in my opinion thi joker ha line that linger longer into the memori overal not absolut perfect but it is extrem good thank to primarili ledger perform and the dazzl visual spectacl bethani cox,Positive

"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight* is not just a superhero film; it is a gripping crime drama that transcends its genre to deliver a profound narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the human condition.

The film masterfully balances action with deep character development, showcasing Batman's struggle against not only external threats but also his internal demons. The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, particularly Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, which redefines the archetype of the villain. Ledger's Joker is chilling and chaotic, serving as the perfect foil to Batman's quest for justice.

Nolan's direction is taut, crafting a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The screenplay is sharp, blending intense action sequences with thought-provoking dialogue that raises significant ethical questions about the nature of heroism versus vigilantism.

The cinematography and score further elevate the film, with the haunting themes underscoring the emotional weight of the story. Each frame is meticulously crafted, contributing to an immersive experience that draws audiences into Gotham's dark underbelly.

Overall, *The Dark Knight* is a landmark in filmmaking that demands to be experienced. It is not only a thrilling ride filled with unforgettable moments but also a poignant exploration of the dichotomy between order and chaos, making it a film that resonates long after the credits roll.

"When I watched the dark knight for the first time, I was about 16 and I had mixed feelings towards it, I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer. Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after 'watching and having few knowledge' about some critically acclaimed films like ""the departed"", "" Inception "" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre .It was a game changer for my taste in films. It still tops the superhero genre even after 14 years of it's release. The only superhero/comic book film which comes close to this one is ""Logan"" in my opinion. So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of it's exploration towards many themes like human nature, dark reality of society, nature of lies, true and false characteristics and many more. Considering other parameters like cinematography, background score and screenplay, I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolan's films. So I end my review here, thanks for reading.

"""The Dark Knight"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic success that transcends the superhero genre, leaving a lasting mark on the world of film. Nolan masterfully weaves a complex and morally ambiguous take of chaos and order, exploring the thin line between heroism and villainy. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is legendary! He is a force of nature and added layers of depth to the character. Heath Ledger steals every scene with a magnetic presence that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. Christopher Nolan's vision, coupled with Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance makes it an instant modern classic.",the dark knight isnt just a movi it a cinemat success that transcend the superhero genr leav a last mark on the world of film nolan master weav a complex and moral ambigu take of chao and order explor the thin line between heroism and villaini heath ledger portray of the joker is legendari he is a forc of natur and ad layer of depth to the charact heath ledger steal everi scene with a magnet presenc that is both terrifi and mesmer christoph nolan vision coupl with heath ledger unforgett perform make it an instant modern classic,Neutral

"Quite simply ""Dark Knight"" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a ""proper"" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).

Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't ""just"" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of ""dark"" and of perception of ""society."" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.

Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these ""abilities"" about him which are soooo unrealistic.

So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.

The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!

I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!

Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.

It's cool It's original It's awesome

"Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.

""The Dark Knight"" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from ""Prison Break"", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but ""sometimes the truth is not good enough"".

"Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from cliché, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good.",write thi review at the tail end of open weekend the dark knight ha broken the record for open weekend and deservedli so thi film is a stepabov the standard summer blockbust howev the film also sit atop imdb top film of alltim list a rank that wont last nearli a long a it boxoffic rank line have been long to see thi film and mani of those who are vote on thi open weekend are diehard who wait in line and were readi to love thi film regardless of what it offer of cours the fact that thi film stand alon in it genr in term of write cinematographi art design and plot help boost it rate into the stratospher but when the non diehard begin to watch and vote well see thi film settl into it right place somewher in the top of all time it one of those few film that is entertain and access enough to plea the same peopl who went out in drove for spiderman while artist and smart enough to plea the more discern cinemat audienc truli disturb the charact were far from cliché a one would expect from the genr no charact is allgood or allbad ledger joker come close but earn a touch of sympathi none of the hero are flawless which is a sign of ani good film my singl complaint besid the variou hardtobeliev fall batman surviv is the rate thi film is fartoo disturb to garner a pg rate and deal with the ugliest side of human in a way that should probabl be accompani by a good convers that can add some perspect yet anoth reason whi thi film is so good,Negative
"And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like ""awesome"" and ""fantastic"" are thrown around way too much. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the plot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not in the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in almost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil.

The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace.

I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool.

I guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype.

"First of all, no I don't think this movie is bad. But I don't think it should be thought of as the gold standart for comic book movies. Because honestly, this movie doesn't feel like a comic book.

This is a very good action movie, that dresses it's main protagonist and antagonist as comic book characters. And here I think lies the problem.

This is a movie about a billionaire, dressed as a bat, who beats an anarchist clown. And Christopher Nolan tries to make this look serious. I'm sorry, it doesn't work. It just takes away the comic book feeling. And therefore it becomes a little boring. If Heath Ledger isn't on the screen I find myself hardly invested in what's happening.

To be honest, I never really liked this movie that much. Maybe because I first watched when I was 8 and it felt boring. But I watched it a few times in later years and I still remember only pieces of fractions of what's happening, outside of scenes that have the Joker. And to be fair, I probably wouldn't have remembered those pieces, if I didn't watch reviews out of boredom.

I went online to see if there is anybody who feels the same way and they all said the same thing: Heath Ledger single handedly saves this movie. And while his performance is spectacular, I can't think of him as a definitive Joker. He is good for this movie, but I'm not sure if I can see him fit in other Batman movies. And a personal bias of mine is that no one is ever going to top Mark Hamill. However, Ledger did his own thing and he did good. Unlike other main charachters in the movie, this one won people over. But it's still in a movie that plays everything too serious.

It feels like Nolan took the main charachters from a comic book and put them in this, just because otherwise it would have been just another action movie. It lacks a certain element. It lacks that comic book campiness, that even the most serious comic books have a pinch of in them. And therefore it fails to deliver as a comic book movie.

That's not to say that being serious is a bad change. Too many comic book are corny as hell and very often it gets annoying. But if you get too serious, you get boring. One should not be at the expense of the other. One must find a balance between the comic book campiness and the seriousness of the real world.

To quote a certain character: Why so serious?",first of all no i dont think thi movi is bad but i dont think it should be thought of a the gold standart for comic book movi becaus honestli thi movi doesnt feel like a comic book thi is a veri good action movi that dress it main protagonist and antagonist a comic book charact and here i think lie the problem thi is a movi about a billionair dress a a bat who beat an anarchist clown and christoph nolan tri to make thi look seriou im sorri it doesnt work it just take away the comic book feel and therefor it becom a littl bore if heath ledger isnt on the screen i find myself hardli invest in what happen to be honest i never realli like thi movi that much mayb becaus i first watch when i wa and it felt bore but i watch it a few time in later year and i still rememb onli piec of fraction of what happen outsid of scene that have the joker and to be fair i probabl wouldnt have rememb those piec if i didnt watch review out of boredom i went onlin to see if there is anybodi who feel the same way and they all said the same thing heath ledger singl handedli save thi movi and while hi perform is spectacular i cant think of him a a definit joker he is good for thi movi but im not sure if i can see him fit in other batman movi and a person bia of mine is that no one is ever go to top mark hamil howev ledger did hi own thing and he did good unlik other main characht in the movi thi one won peopl over but it still in a movi that play everyth too seriou it feel like nolan took the main characht from a comic book and put them in thi just becaus otherwis it would have been just anoth action movi it lack a certain element it lack that comic book campi that even the most seriou comic book have a pinch of in them and therefor it fail to deliv a a comic book movi that not to say that be seriou is a bad chang too mani comic book are corni a hell and veri often it get annoy but if you get too seriou you get bore one should not be at the expens of the other one must find a balanc between the comic book campi and the serious of the real world to quot a certain charact whi so seriou,Positive
"The Dark Knight actually got lucky. Movies over the last six years have been crap. Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.

It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.

The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining. Besides, movies over the last few years are all dark - even the light-hearted ones.

"for weeks leading up to the film movie insiders have been claiming that not only is it the best batman movie but that heath ledger deserves a Oscar nod for his work as the joker here is my short take on the film sorry its 4am and i just got home. the film overall is about as good as its every going to get as a action film and as a film on its own i really do think as of what i have seen so far it deserves at least a Oscar nom for best film the acting alround is just top shelf stuff. i will say this the film felt abit long but it needed to be. OK on to the cast, batman from watching the trailers and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i was worried that batman would be pushed into the back....this is not the case. the film overall doesn't follow one person it follows the story and i think thats what makes it such a good movie cause in the end the story is the important part. OK my one knock on the film heath ledgers joker was good but i didn't think it was Oscar good, i will say he holds his own with jack's joker....actually i think its better but i don't think is Oscar good. i liked the way they used him in the film he pops in does the damage and pops out and it really works best that way. now Aaron Eckhart's two face/dent makes tommy lee's a joke....but really aaron take on both dent and twoface were amazing the characters are taken to deep levels and it really gave the film a extra kick and props to the special effects guys it looked so real. bale i think carries the story well just like in begins while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movie over all turns out better for it, and its not like he doesn't have his moments ether. Gyllenhaal replaces homes and honestly i would have rather homes im not saying she did a bad job i just think with home's work on thank you for smoking she would have been a better choice if they could of had her. or wanted her? finally the supports of freeman caine and oldmen work just as well as they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of his screen time overall its easy to say this is by far the best of the batman movies. if i had to compare it to anything its like saying batman begins is like a star war iv and D.K is like EP:v both are good but this one just takes it that next level up",for week lead up to the film movi insid have been claim that not onli is it the best batman movi but that heath ledger deserv a oscar nod for hi work a the joker here is my short take on the film sorri it am and i just got home the film overal is about a good a it everi go to get a a action film and a a film on it own i realli do think a of what i have seen so far it deserv at least a oscar nom for best film the act alround is just top shelf stuff i will say thi the film felt abit long but it need to be ok on to the cast batman from watch the trailer and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i wa worri that batman would be push into the backthi is not the case the film overal doesnt follow one person it follow the stori and i think that what make it such a good movi caus in the end the stori is the import part ok my one knock on the film heath ledger joker wa good but i didnt think it wa oscar good i will say he hold hi own with jack jokeractu i think it better but i dont think is oscar good i like the way they use him in the film he pop in doe the damag and pop out and it realli work best that way now aaron eckhart two faced make tommi lee a jokebut realli aaron take on both dent and twofac were amaz the charact are taken to deep level and it realli gave the film a extra kick and prop to the special effect guy it look so real bale i think carri the stori well just like in begin while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movi over all turn out better for it and it not like he doesnt have hi moment ether gyllenha replac home and honestli i would have rather home im not say she did a bad job i just think with home work on thank you for smoke she would have been a better choic if they could of had her or want her final the support of freeman cain and oldmen work just a well a they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of hi screen time overal it easi to say thi is by far the best of the batman movi if i had to compar it to anyth it like say batman begin is like a star war iv and dk is like epv both are good but thi one just take it that next level up,Positive

"I know it sounds a bit too cliché when someone says this, but this is undoubtedly one of, if not the best superhero movie ever created! It excels in every field it touches - The visual effects are done perfectly, the acting is absolutely Oscar worthy, the multiple storylines that don't seem too complex in spite of being told at the same time and in spite of being just one movie of a trilogy it managed to win the hearts of everyone who saw it.

The story picks up very well from where Batman Begins ended. The post credit scene in that movie had shown Joker, and I can very well imagine how excited the audience must have been seeing it. The Batman and Joker duo is used to describe the social aspects of the society, and explain how people might behave if they are left unhinged. A hero who has his moral codes and a lot to lose, compared to a villain without any moral codes and nothing to lose yet have so much in common than what meets the normal eye. Ultimately both are seen as freaks who must be eliminated by the law.

Let's talk about the characters, starting from Christian Bale's Batman. His voice sounds horrible as Batman. Nowadays many people have begun criticising it, but they don't realise that if a real Batman has to change his voice, he only has two ways of doing it - either using a voice modulator like Ben Affleck's Batman does, or deal with trying to sound different, which isn't easy when he has to breathe heavily because of how hard he works. It's just fun to see the caped crusader doing something on the screen.

Next let's address Michael Caine's Alfred. He's a good representation of Alfred. Just by looking at him you get the feeling of both a butler and a guardian, something we know Alfred to be. And it can be seen very nicely when he dresses Bruce's wounds or talks to him about his crimefighting.

Then we have Aaron Eckhart's Two Face. Unlike the previous iteration that was seen in Batman Forever, this one seems a lot more serious. He went through a hefty character development, from the patriotic white Knight of Gotham, Harvey Dent, to the deranged psychopath who is ready to cross all limits if he wants to have his revenge.

Jim Gordon is also a much, much better iteration from what we had seen in the 1989 Batman. He actually looks like someone who is invested in his job and can contact Batman whenever he needs help. He is the kind of Gordon I imagine when I think of the animated movies. When someone mentions Jim Gordon, this is the one who comes to my mind.

And finally the elephant in the room, the show stealer - Heath Ledger's Joker. Just like Two Face, Joker here has also gone through a complete makeover from what he was portrayed as in the previous movie that came in 1989. It's kinda sad that Heath Ledger never got to know how famous he has become, but his legacy shall forever live in the DC universe.

The Dark Knight is one movie I often come back to just to remember these kinds of superhero movies are also possible. Every DC character should be given such movies where their character is shown to develop as time moves on.

"The film was very disappointing. Firstly Heath Ledger, wow didn't see that coming. He was terrific. From A knights tale to the dark knight...... not the same actor surely. The tongue flicks and glaring at the camera were very real indeed. I am going to compare this to the 1989 film because in recent times that is the best comparison we can make. The 89 film was entertaining, this wasn't. It was too dark, too dreary and left me feeling a bit depressed which just isn't the aim of comics. Christian Bale's voice as Batman was ridiculous, I didn't have any empathy with his character at all, didn't feel for him.... just nothing. Thought that I wouldn't want to live in Gotham as it was so dreary and felt that Commissioner Gordon was just too earnest. Chris Nolan gave us the excellent Memento and I think another good film in Insomnia. Though I appreciate the lack of CGI (very refreshing) and the last half an hour of the film, i fidgeted throughout and by the end felt I could have left early. Last year the Bourne Ultimatum rattled along and I came out of the cinema entertained. This was just depressing.

"After defeating the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have little time to return to normal life. The mafia is growing, and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger, in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals, no goals, no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also, a love triangle forms between Wayne, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).

There's little use in writing a review of ""The Dark Knight"" -- the critics loved it, fans love it, the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it, too, making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck, even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor).

I could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The ""Bat-Sonar"" was far-fetched, cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting, encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So, there was room for perfection (which is why this film, as great as it is, cannot receive a perfect score).

Concerns aside, the film was well done, as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige""). The action is intense, the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense, plot twists, unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fiancé fairly fast). And Heath Ledger, oh my.

The hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric, declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However, the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker, inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but Ledger brings his ""A"" game. If he is nominated, I accept it; and if he wins, that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year, in any genre.

As I said in the beginning, my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true, but judging by the sales of the picture, you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't, see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly, depending on the special features).

"Normally I would give this a 7.5 out of 10 but since I cant' I'll give it a seven. How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDb.com is amazing to me. It's mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one, it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have rated.

A couple things I noticed when I watch this movie, the movie goes on way too long. Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans. There are about 3 or 4 points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another 30 minutes. And while Heath Ledger's performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly, his Batman persona is a bit weak. The voice is annoying, and many times throughout the movie, he seemingly plays second fiddle.

I can't know Eckhart's casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesn't seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candy.

There are many things I can harp about but I'm not here to knock the movie. There are good points, cinematography great, Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts, mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too long.

"What is going on with all of these maximum ratings for a barely average film? According to IMDb, this is the best film of the decade so far. Not one sane person could argue that this is justified. Have the studios finally managed to get the masses to 'believe the hype'? I was a bit skeptical about this film, due to the hype, and especially because I wasn't impressed with Batman Begins, but I must admit, the heist in the first five minutes was excellent, and I thought my skepticism was unwarranted. But then Batman turned up and began speaking like a wrestler with throat cancer, and it continued to go down hill from there. What I didn't expect this film to be was tedious. But it was. It was far too long and bored my pants off me. There was no character development, the story was convoluted and over-complex and it was far too long. But my my main problem, and this goes against nearly every reviewer here, even those who weren't impressed, I thought Heath Ledger was absolutely awful! Who are these people calling for a posthumous Oscar? There is nothing I despise more than a 'look at me' performance. Ledger did all the tricks required to portray a 'crazy guy', including shifting his eyes up, down, left and right at every opportunity, and ingeniously, due to having his mouth cut as a child, he keeps licking around the inside of his mouth, which rather than being an impressive feat of method acting is actually as irritating as watching a fat man eat chips with his mouth open. His performance was utterly self-indulgent and it seems like all you sycophants fell for it. The only decent acting performance in this film is Eckhart. Caine and Morgan bore, and Bale, with his 'employ me for movie trailers' voice barely has one dimension. I would have rated this film higher if it hadn't taken itself so seriously, but as it stands it is a pretentious hyped-up and tedious movie.

"A perfectly made movie, with Heath Ledger at his best. Batman Begins started the trend of 'dark/serious' movies, and just when you thought a movie couldn't be better... The Dark Knight came out with an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger.

"Whatever else it may be, ""The Dark Knight,"" Christopher Nolan's follow up to his ""Batman Begins,"" the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It's full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and don't let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can't possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.

The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and it's through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger's creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He's not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.

I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and it's this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.

The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.

So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it's still, after all, a Batman movie, and it's not the best film since ""Citizen Kane.""

"This is the first movie sense The Lord of the Rings movies that had mad, crazy, super hype and surpassed it. I thought it was getting hyped up for the wrong reasons (the tragedy). I had my doubts going into this film because everyone was talking about the Ledger. After seeing so many previews, after seeing the film and knowing what other films the actor was in, he NAILED the Joker.

I was happy that the film had more to offer than the preview had shown. It had some unexpected moments (which was good) and everyone one, and I do mean, everyone to include the bit players were wonderful in this movie. Nolan commanded and got some of the best work out of these people. Christian Bale just cemented that he is either better but no less than at the same level as Keaton's Batman and in the way, director Nolan film is better because it's more raw than Tim Burton's Batman. It doesn't seem like some faraway city. Kudos also goes to the City of Chicago for allowing Nolan to do whatever he wanted, so we have a lot less blue screen (cgi) effects and more realistic action sequences.

But the man of the hour, is Heath Ledger. Like in so many movies where the villain steals the movie, this is no exception. You can see and sense the insanity in Ledger's Joker. I mean Jack Nicholson played Jack in the first Batman, but who would have expected this demented performance out of Ledger. And it was a great performance without the over the top, maniacal campiness that actors tend to do when playing villains.

Now the only thing I wasn't crazy about was Batman's voice, it sounded a bit fake and it was hard to hear at times because it was so low. But that didn't take ANYTHING at all, away from the movie. This is a must to see on the big screen. I think its a must to see on the big screen twice and it's a must purchase on blu-ray when it's release. The movie runs about 2 hours and 45 minutes so be sure to take your bathroom break before the film start because you will not want to miss a minute.

Director/Writer Christopher Nolan has that special film makers touch. He screwed with out Heads with Memento. He dazzled us with The Presitge (another movie with Bale in it). He reinvigorated us with Batman Begins and now he stuns us with the well-crafted ""Dark Knight"". We all seen what could happen to a franchise in the hands of a lesser director (Batman Returns, Batman and Robin) and its nice to see something that takes your breath away. The Dark Knight will win lots of awards, but I think it already won the biggest, audience approval.

"I have enjoyed batman for a long time and despite my rabid fanaticism this movie took me to a whole new level. This is barely a superhero movie; it's utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all means. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the story, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledger's death which I feared might make the movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is a wonderful actress as Katie Holmes' replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was rather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the least, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for his performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own thespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined to have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You don't have to be a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless bubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid footing in this area.

"Frank Miller's The Dark Knight was one of the greatest comic series ever made. I was a young comic book collector when it first came out and I remember buying 5 copies a couple of days after its release and then watching it sell out in a few weeks. The price for the first edition sky-rocketed after just a couple of months to over $100, as second and third runs were printed.

What Miller did was nothing short of revolutionary. He depicted the Batman much the same way as the original 1930s Batman comics did - as a nearly maniacal, shadowy vigilante who sets forth to strike fear into the hearts of villains throughout Gotham. But he deepened the internal conflicts, the personal relationships, and the psychological aspects of the stories - especially the 2-3 episodes that dealt with the Joker. Miller's Joker was the flip-side of the Batman. An entirely sociopathic force for chaos and evil - and not entirely unlike the Batman at a deep structural level - driven by a similar kind of megalomania. The commonalities between the characters were just enough to shake Bruce Wayne to his core and to cause him to question everything he stood for.

Take note - With Iron Man and this film, Comic Book Films Have finally begun to realize their full potential.

Thankfully, The Dark Knight took aspects of Miller's version of the Joker and brought them to the screen faithfully - with adequate but not overbearing special effects, great acting talent, and a script worthy of Miller's work.

The Joker, devastatingly played by Heath Ledger, is not the quirky Cesar Romero prankster, nor the slightly demonic Jack Nicholson Commodore of Crime, but rather Frank Miller's ingenious, amoral, homicidal maniac. And he is anything but funny. The Joker reigns terror down on Gotham through a series of increasingly murderous experiments designed to test his nihilistic hypothesis concerning human nature. The Batman is being hunted by a righteous new district attorney for his vigilante approach to justice, and it is becoming increasingly clear that crime has stepped up its skill and intelligence to meet him at his own level. Bruce Wayne, plagued by personal difficulties and the deep conflicts of his dual life considers hanging up his cloak just when Gotham needs him most. But something about the Joker gets way under his skin.

The film even captures Miller's dark aesthetic of Gotham and the Batman consistently. Ledger is perfect, Bale is very good (though he was not given the depth afforded the Joker by the script, the story dictates that this will change in the next film), and the excellent, star-studded, supporting cast makes this blockbuster worth seeing by just about anybody.

For those who know the story and bring great expectations to this film - you will be rewarded with catharsis. For those who don't - prepare to see something you would never expect from a comic book based film - intense psychological drama and powerfully realized characterization.For those who are just looking for a fun and entertaining action film - you will get more than you bargained for in The Dark Knight, but may find it too lengthy and dark for your tastes.",frank miller the dark knight wa one of the greatest comic seri ever made i wa a young comic book collector when it first came out and i rememb buy copi a coupl of day after it releas and then watch it sell out in a few week the price for the first edit skyrocket after just a coupl of month to over a second and third run were print what miller did wa noth short of revolutionari he depict the batman much the same way a the origin s batman comic did a a nearli maniac shadowi vigilant who set forth to strike fear into the heart of villain throughout gotham but he deepen the intern conflict the person relationship and the psycholog aspect of the stori especi the episod that dealt with the joker miller joker wa the flipsid of the batman an entir sociopath forc for chao and evil and not entir unlik the batman at a deep structur level driven by a similar kind of megalomania the common between the charact were just enough to shake bruce wayn to hi core and to caus him to question everyth he stood for take note with iron man and thi film comic book film have final begun to realiz their full potenti thank the dark knight took aspect of miller version of the joker and brought them to the screen faith with adequ but not overbear special effect great act talent and a script worthi of miller work the joker devastatingli play by heath ledger is not the quirki cesar romero prankster nor the slightli demon jack nicholson commodor of crime but rather frank miller ingeni amor homicid maniac and he is anyth but funni the joker reign terror down on gotham through a seri of increasingli murder experi design to test hi nihilist hypothesi concern human natur the batman is be hunt by a righteou new district attorney for hi vigilant approach to justic and it is becom increasingli clear that crime ha step up it skill and intellig to meet him at hi own level bruce wayn plagu by person difficulti and the deep conflict of hi dual life consid hang up hi cloak just when gotham need him most but someth about the joker get way under hi skin the film even captur miller dark aesthet of gotham and the batman consist ledger is perfect bale is veri good though he wa not given the depth afford the joker by the script the stori dictat that thi will chang in the next film and the excel starstud support cast make thi blockbust worth see by just about anybodi for those who know the stori and bring great expect to thi film you will be reward with catharsi for those who dont prepar to see someth you would never expect from a comic book base film intens psycholog drama and power realiz characterizationfor those who are just look for a fun and entertain action film you will get more than you bargain for in the dark knight but may find it too lengthi and dark for your tast,Positive
"""The Dark Knight"" is, without a doubt, a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's second installment in the Batman trilogy takes everything that made ""Batman Begins"" great and cranks it up to an entirely new level.

First and foremost, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. His performance is haunting, mesmerizing, and unforgettable. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, and his ability to channel the character's madness is truly remarkable. It's a performance that stands as one of the greatest in cinematic history.

Christian Bale continues to excel as Batman, bringing depth and complexity to the role. The film's exploration of Batman's moral dilemmas and the blurred lines between heroism and vigilantism add a layer of sophistication to the character.

The supporting cast, including Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, all deliver outstanding performances that contribute to the film's overall brilliance.

What sets ""The Dark Knight"" apart from other superhero movies is its gritty and realistic portrayal of Gotham City. Nolan's direction and use of practical effects create a visually stunning and immersive world that feels tangible and lived-in.

The film's themes of chaos, morality, and the consequences of one's actions are thought-provoking and add depth to the narrative. The moral dilemmas faced by the characters make for a compelling and complex story that keeps you engaged from start to finish.

Additionally, Hans Zimmer's score is pulse-pounding and adds to the tension and excitement of the film's action sequences.

""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a superhero movie; it's a dark and gripping crime drama that explores the darkest corners of the human psyche. It's a film that challenges the audience to think and leaves a lasting impact.

"""Batman: The Dark Knight"" is an absolute masterpiece that transcends the superhero genre and stands as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time.

One of the most remarkable aspects of this film is Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. Ledger's portrayal of the iconic villain is nothing short of mesmerizing. He completely disappears into the character, delivering a chilling and unforgettable performance. Ledger's Joker is chaotic, unpredictable, and utterly compelling. His every scene is a masterclass in acting, and it's no surprise that he posthumously won an Academy Award for his role.

Christian Bale continues to excel as Bruce Wayne/Batman. His brooding intensity and unwavering commitment to the role make him one of the most compelling Batman interpretations to date. Bale's dedication to his craft is evident in every scene, and he brings a complex depth to the character.

Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent/Two-Face is another standout performance. His transformation from a principled district attorney to a vengeful and disfigured villain is handled with nuance and skill. It's a tragic arc that adds emotional weight to the film.

The film's screenplay, penned by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan, is a triumph of storytelling. It weaves together multiple plot threads, themes of morality, chaos, and the nature of heroism, and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish.

"OK, lets get it out of the way, I'm a massive Batman fan. I loved the TV show when I was a kid, really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions. I've even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels. I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one. So how come I've just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed? Why? Because this film just wasn't that good. It's far too long, has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously it's painful. The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought. The whole thing was one great, big, dreadful, noisy, mess. The only good thing in it is Heath Ledger's performance. I had my doubts when I first heard who'd they'd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath, he pulled it off. No thanks to the film however, which is so over cooked it's burnt. Sure there's loads of action, cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul. It was great looking but has no personality. I felt neither happy, scared or even mildly concerned let alone entertained. I really didn't give a damn. So next time people, slim it down, less is more.

"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that seamlessly blends intense action, profound storytelling, and unforgettable performances. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of mesmerizing, elevating the film to unparalleled heights. Nolan's direction, coupled with Hans Zimmer's iconic score, creates a dark and immersive atmosphere that captivates audiences from start to finish. The film's exploration of morality and the complexities of heroism cements its status as a modern masterpiece in the superhero genre.

"It's a very soft 9, but it's a 9/10 for me.

Directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer - these guys are in their primes here. Not that the same isn't true of some of the actors involved in this film, Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart.

It's hard for me to do a review on this film and certainly the character of the late Heath Ledger is one of the greatest villains in cinema history. He is played to perfection. Perfect would even be putting it mildly. Ledger is so great in this film that all the awards and recognition he has received from around the world are too little.

Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Gary Oldman are all super, but the one who shines brightest out of the entire cast with the exception of Ledger is Aaron Eckhart and his character, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Christopher Nolan's hidden ace. A perfect addition to the film's story.

The action scenes are OK, the sound is good, the film is generally very good technically and is far from the most successful in the genre, but the acting, the pacing and the story itself make The Dark Knight (2008) the giant that it is.

I recommend it along with the other two installments in the series, ""Batman Begins"" (2005), and the not-so-good ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012).

Final score: 9/10.",it a veri soft but it a for me direct by christoph nolan and written by christoph nolan jonathan nolan and david s goyer these guy are in their prime here not that the same isnt true of some of the actor involv in thi film heath ledger and aaron eckhart it hard for me to do a review on thi film and certainli the charact of the late heath ledger is one of the greatest villain in cinema histori he is play to perfect perfect would even be put it mildli ledger is so great in thi film that all the award and recognit he ha receiv from around the world are too littl christian bale michael cain maggi gyllenha and gari oldman are all super but the one who shine brightest out of the entir cast with the except of ledger is aaron eckhart and hi charact harvey denttwo face christoph nolan hidden ace a perfect addit to the film stori the action scene are ok the sound is good the film is gener veri good technic and is far from the most success in the genr but the act the pace and the stori itself make the dark knight the giant that it is i recommend it along with the other two instal in the seri batman begin and the notsogood the dark knight rise final score,Neutral
"I've been waiting for this film since I had seen Batman Begins in the cinema three/four years ago, but I was disappointed that I did not see anything new. It also didn't help that the plot in the film was muddled up. There were different subplots happening in between the film and by the last half I was totally lost; even my boyfriend has fallen asleep. I didn't like Maggie Gyllenhal's role as Rachael - she was bland as a blank of wood/black tea with no sugar, *really* boring as an actress!

As usual, Bale puts on a great performance and I have always enjoyed the films he has been in from the past (Machinist, The Prestige, Equiliberium, Batman Begins, American Psycho). However, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne, I felt I hadn't seen anything fresh from his performance or, if there was, this was overshadowed by the film (I am sure he will make up for this in Terminator 4). I like Christopher Nolan as well as a director, but I think this film was all about money and not about quality film-making. Compare this film to Memento and The Prestige - the Dark Knight is nowhere near as good as those films. In other words, from the 'success' this film has made, it would look as though Nolan has sold out which is a real shame.

I have idea no where thes hype about this film has come from, but I suspect it is because of the fact that people have been defining this film as one of Heath Ledger's ""finest performance"". Sure, his role as the Joker worked well on screen, but, even so, it is not worthy of winning a BAFTA/Oscar for his performance. People have generously given this film either a 9/10 simply because they have bought the fascination surrounding Ledger's performance/death along with the excessive violence and not judging on this film, realistically.

This film is worth no more than a 6, I am afraid - it should NOT be in IMDb's top 10.

"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" isn't merely a superhero movie; it's a magnum opus that redefines the genre. At its core is Heath Ledger's haunting portrayal of the Joker, a character study that delves into the darkest corners of human psyche. Ledger's performance is a revelation, crafting a Joker that is simultaneously terrifying and captivating.

Christian Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne is equally compelling, showcasing the internal struggle of a hero burdened by his sense of duty and the blurred line between justice and vengeance. The supporting cast, including Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman, deliver exceptional performances, adding layers of complexity to the narrative.

Nolan's direction is nothing short of genius, transforming Gotham City into a character itself-a gritty, sprawling urban landscape plagued by crime and corruption. The film's action sequences are meticulously choreographed, and the practical effects create a visceral sense of realism rarely seen in superhero films.

What sets ""The Dark Knight"" apart is its exploration of moral ambiguity and the choices that define us. The film raises profound questions about society, justice, and the nature of good and evil, challenging the audience's perceptions long after the credits roll. Hans Zimmer's score is the soul of the movie, underscoring the tension and emotion with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack.

In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that continues to captivate audiences worldwide. Its exceptional performances, intricate storytelling, and thought-provoking themes elevate it to the realm of timeless classics. A film that lingers in the mind and demands multiple viewings, ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a testament to the power of storytelling and remains an essential watch for anyone seeking profound cinematic experiences.",christoph nolan the dark knight isnt mere a superhero movi it a magnum opu that redefin the genr at it core is heath ledger haunt portray of the joker a charact studi that delv into the darkest corner of human psych ledger perform is a revel craft a joker that is simultan terrifi and captiv christian bale batmanbruc wayn is equal compel showcas the intern struggl of a hero burden by hi sen of duti and the blur line between justic and vengeanc the support cast includ aaron eckhart gari oldman and morgan freeman deliv except perform ad layer of complex to the narr nolan direct is noth short of geniu transform gotham citi into a charact itselfa gritti sprawl urban landscap plagu by crime and corrupt the film action sequenc are meticul choreograph and the practic effect creat a viscer sen of realism rare seen in superhero film what set the dark knight apart is it explor of moral ambigu and the choic that defin u the film rais profound question about societi justic and the natur of good and evil challeng the audienc percept long after the credit roll han zimmer score is the soul of the movi underscor the tension and emot with a hauntingli beauti soundtrack in conclus the dark knight is a cinemat triumph that continu to captiv audienc worldwid it except perform intric storytel and thoughtprovok theme elev it to the realm of timeless classic a film that linger in the mind and demand multipl view the dark knight stand a a testament to the power of storytel and remain an essenti watch for anyon seek profound cinemat experi,Neutral

"I would say best film related to superhero, for was last film with popular superhero I was able to watch without getting bored. Now day most of the stories are dreadful. The screenplay, penned by Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan, is a triumph of storytelling. The film's plot is intricate and multi-layered, exploring themes of chaos, morality, and the nature of heroism. It challenges both its characters and the audience to grapple with difficult questions, making it a cerebral experience within the superhero genre.

"Remember when the joker explains why he uses a knife instead of a gun? He prefers to savour the little details, read between the lines, appreciate the moment. As opposed to a violent, quick thrill of a gun. For me this film ended up being more like a machine gun than a knife.

Let's start with the excellent aspects of this film. Strong performances - Bale is fantastic, Michael Caine and Morgan freeman always produce excellent performances and this again does not disappoint, Heath ledger is impeccable. Music score is incredible by Hans Zimmer. Cannot imagine a better soundtrack is possible for this film. Epic use of image, immersing cinematography, the make up and costume department need a raise.

What's a mixed bag and what's poor . The plot - the plot is decent, but far from outstanding. It's about half an hour too long. There's certainly one chapter too many. In the last 45 mins we have hospital gate and ferry gate. You really need to choose only one there. The ferry scene paints to us what the joker is trying to prove - that when it comes down to it everyone will become selfish, save themselves before others no matter the cost. However I don't think they quite hit the nail on the head with it. The way it pans out, for me, is too unrealistic. Call it my lack of faith in human nature. I feel a more believable scenario of human heroism would've sent a stronger message. Hospital gate provides very little to the plot, except 20 mins of watching a headache. Philosophical themes and execution - Heath Ledger's acting is incredible so don't come at me, but the joker is too one dimensional. I get it, he likes chaos, but I want more depth. It may be good enough for the comics but not for a film to the caliber of this one. There's just a little too much spoon feeding dialogue. All this talk about chaos and human nature. Allow the audience to read between the lines, decifer the deeper meanings for themselves. Be a knife, not a gun. Pacing - I can't really fault the pacing until it comes to Harvey's transformation into two face. This part of the film is really poor. Even when I watched this film as a kid I was like come on. It's not even a character arc , he more or less wakes up a sadistic maniac, like Peter Parker just wakes up as spider man. Im not saying two face is a bad character, but a substantially more amount of time is necessary for us as the audience to realistically believe this transformation from hero to villain. And lastly, the film is just a bit too crash bang wallop. Just turn the volume down a little bit.

Now, I admit this review focuses more on the bad than the good. I can only say that's because everyone rates this film so highly that I think the weaknesses are more relevant. It's a great film and I understand the hype. But we have to admit there are major flaws to this film. I hate the way people really brand the word about 'overrated' , I don't like using it - it makes you sound as a sort of Scrooge. However , with an IMDB rating of 9/10 I think there might be a strong case for it right here.",rememb when the joker explain whi he use a knife instead of a gun he prefer to savour the littl detail read between the line appreci the moment a oppos to a violent quick thrill of a gun for me thi film end up be more like a machin gun than a knife let start with the excel aspect of thi film strong perform bale is fantast michael cain and morgan freeman alway produc excel perform and thi again doe not disappoint heath ledger is impecc music score is incred by han zimmer cannot imagin a better soundtrack is possibl for thi film epic use of imag immers cinematographi the make up and costum depart need a rais what a mix bag and what poor the plot the plot is decent but far from outstand it about half an hour too long there certainli one chapter too mani in the last min we have hospit gate and ferri gate you realli need to choos onli one there the ferri scene paint to u what the joker is tri to prove that when it come down to it everyon will becom selfish save themselv befor other no matter the cost howev i dont think they quit hit the nail on the head with it the way it pan out for me is too unrealist call it my lack of faith in human natur i feel a more believ scenario of human heroism wouldv sent a stronger messag hospit gate provid veri littl to the plot except min of watch a headach philosoph theme and execut heath ledger act is incred so dont come at me but the joker is too one dimension i get it he like chao but i want more depth it may be good enough for the comic but not for a film to the calib of thi one there just a littl too much spoon feed dialogu all thi talk about chao and human natur allow the audienc to read between the line decif the deeper mean for themselv be a knife not a gun pace i cant realli fault the pace until it come to harvey transform into two face thi part of the film is realli poor even when i watch thi film a a kid i wa like come on it not even a charact arc he more or less wake up a sadist maniac like peter parker just wake up a spider man im not say two face is a bad charact but a substanti more amount of time is necessari for u a the audienc to realist believ thi transform from hero to villain and lastli the film is just a bit too crash bang wallop just turn the volum down a littl bit now i admit thi review focus more on the bad than the good i can onli say that becaus everyon rate thi film so highli that i think the weak are more relev it a great film and i understand the hype but we have to admit there are major flaw to thi film i hate the way peopl realli brand the word about overr i dont like use it it make you sound a a sort of scroog howev with an imdb rate of i think there might be a strong case for it right here,Positive
"The trick to these comic book superhero movies is not to take the source material too seriously. That's what made the original Batman from the 1980's, with Jack Nickolson as the Joker, work so well; everything about that movie, including all the main characters, was over the top, and rightfully so. We are, after all, talking about a man who goes out and fights crime while dressed up as a bat. How seriously, really, are we supposed to take such a notion? But this movie (among its various other flaws) takes itself WAY too seriously. It's supposed to be some deep, even epic, tale of, well, something. But, hey, if I want that, I could read Homer. Or Shakespeare. Or watch ""The Godfather"". Stories that truly are epic, in no small part because they feature real human characters, not ones that came out of a cartoon book.

That said, I can only review so much of this movie because, quite honestly, I don't remember all that much from it. Nothing about it truly stood out in my mind, other than that the general theme seemed to be to inflict upon the audience several scenes of considerable cruelty and sadism. And, unlike in other movies where these qualities played a significant role (Silence of the Lambs, Apocalypse Now), here these elements seem to exist solely for shock value, not because they actually add anything to our deeper understanding of the story.

Which brings us to the character of the Joker. Let me be blunt - Nickolson's Joker was at least ten times better than this one. Both are completely unbelievable, but Jack's Joker was at least interesting, even fun. He was a pleasure to watch in much the same way that a good James Bond villain is. But there is nothing pleasurable at all about Heath Ledger's Joker. First off, he is so psychotic that he couldn't function anywhere outside of an insane asylum; he kills off his own henchmen, burns their stolen money before their very eyes, yet this psycho somehow enlists a small army of loyal followers without giving them any reason to be loyal at all, and yet, despite being a complete walking mental meltdown, he manages to put in motion any number of very detailed terrorist plots that would require the exact opposite mindset, namely, one of cold and calculating rationality. In short, as a movie villain, he simply fails. Not only is he not credible at all, his sole contribution to the story is to add the aforementioned cruelty and sadism, making this not only a stupid and unbelievable movie, but a thoroughly depressing one as well. I mean, seriously. If you want to see movie characters who have a dark, twisted, and sadistic streak and yet come off as credible on the screen, one need look no further than such persons as Tommy from ""Goodfellas"" or Luca Brasi from ""The Godfather"". But the Joker from this film is just a void. Encountering his character was like stepping on a dog turd. The experience is wholly unpleasant and disgusting, but thankfully you forget about it pretty soon.

Ledger's approach to Joker wasn't the corny 1900s Joker, where he was making corny cartoon jokes. Ledger's joker was a psychological joker, that messed with people's minds and had them looking in every which direction.

"I have seen the Dark Knight multiple times but still love to see it sometimes when i got nothing to do. The movie is still powerfull and full of suprises. The story line is very good; it has multiple stories that are bend togheter in different stages of the movie. That makes the movie atrractive to watch even if you already have seen it.

There is plenty of action with nice realistic combat scenes. The evil Joker is a solid opponent versus batman. I liked the psychological deepness that is showed in different stages inside the story. That makes the movie als interesting for more intelligent people.

Besides batman and the joker, there are three other major roles. You can almost choose witch character you like the most. But watch out; it can be devastating for you in the end!

"Oddly enough, I don't go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that it'll be over-hyped and bloated; that's just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy.

As I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledger's unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isn't just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeare's finest plays.

Let's first get to what I didn't like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movie's predecessor, Batman Begins. See, I've always thought the complex Batman character should be someone who's consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know he's got this secret identity thing going, and he doesn't tell people everything, and that's nice. Endearing, even. But Bale's inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that there's more than meets the eye. Bale's Batman doesn't feel like he's consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim.

Moving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because she's smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we don't see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday they'll get it right.

And then there's the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and it's like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart can't quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy who's better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dent's a noble crusader, the district attorney who's going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll who's there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, you'd think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesn't seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here.

The movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! It's not over yet! What will happen next? But surely there's a way to do this without producing a film that's two and a half hours long. If you're going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City.

But here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruce's conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because it's supposed to be gloomy ol' Gotham.

So for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. It's not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we don't even get clever plotting that we might expect from what's purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. There's much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - that's forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger.",oddli enough i dont go into a theater befor watch a blockbust movi with the

"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that transcends the superhero genre, delivering a dark and immersive experience that is nothing short of spectacular. From its gripping storyline to its impeccable cast, every element of this film contributes to its status as a modern masterpiece.

Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is iconic, a chilling and mesmerizing performance that stands as one of the greatest in cinematic history. Ledger's ability to embody the chaotic nature of the character brings an unparalleled depth to the film, making every scene with the Joker an edge-of-your-seat experience.

Christian Bale reprises his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, and his performance is equally compelling. Bale's nuanced portrayal captures the internal struggles of a hero burdened by the weight of his mission, adding a layer of humanity to the iconic figure.

Nolan's direction is nothing short of brilliant, crafting a Gotham City that feels both gritty and grandiose. The film's pacing is relentless, keeping audiences engaged from start to finish. The use of practical effects and minimal CGI enhances the film's realism, creating a Gotham that feels tangible and immersive.

The screenplay, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, weaves a complex narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the nature of heroism. The dialogue is sharp and thought-provoking, elevating the film beyond typical superhero fare.

Hans Zimmer's score is the heartbeat of ""The Dark Knight,"" intensifying every moment and contributing to the film's emotional depth. The iconic theme associated with the Joker adds an extra layer of unease, perfectly complementing Ledger's phenomenal performance.

In summary, ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic tour de force, a film that transcends its genre and stands as a testament to the artistic potential of superhero storytelling. Christopher Nolan's vision, combined with outstanding performances and technical prowess, has created a film that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the greatest of its time.",christoph nolan the dark knight is a cinemat triumph that transcend the superhero genr deliv a dark and immers experi that is noth short of spectacular from it grip storylin to it impecc cast everi element of thi film contribut to it statu a a modern masterpiec heath ledger portray of the joker is icon a chill and mesmer perform that stand a one of the greatest in cinemat histori ledger abil to embodi the chaotic natur of the charact bring an unparallel depth to the film make everi scene with the joker an edgeofyourseat experi christian bale repris hi role a batmanbruc wayn and hi perform is equal compel bale nuanc portray captur the intern struggl of a hero burden by the weight of hi mission ad a layer of human to the icon figur nolan direct is noth short of brilliant craft a gotham citi that feel both gritti and grandios the film pace is relentless keep audienc engag from start to finish the use of practic effect and minim cgi enhanc the film realism creat a gotham that feel tangibl and immers the screenplay cowritten by nolan and hi brother jonathan weav a complex narr that explor theme of moral chao and the natur of heroism the dialogu is sharp and thoughtprovok elev the film beyond typic superhero fare han zimmer score is the heartbeat of the dark knight intensifi everi moment and contribut to the film emot depth the icon theme associ with the joker add an extra layer of uneas perfectli complement ledger phenomen perform in summari the dark knight is a cinemat tour de forc a film that transcend it genr and stand a a testament to the artist potenti of superhero storytel christoph nolan vision combin with outstand perform and technic prowess ha creat a film that will undoubtedli be rememb a one of the greatest of it time,Positive

"The world of superheroes has always been captivated by larger-than-life characters, but none have left as indelible a mark on pop culture as the iconic Dark Knight. Batman, a character beloved for his complex persona and thrilling adventures, has been brought to life in various mediums, but with the latest film, it's clear that the Caped Crusader has found a new home on the big screen. The 2023 Batman film, directed by visionary filmmaker David Fincher, is a visual masterpiece that brings this iconic character to life in ways that have never been seen before.

For someone like me, whose introduction to Batman came through animated series and comics, this film was a thrilling revelation. I was initially drawn to the character through the brilliant Batman: The Animated Series and various comic books. However, seeing Batman in a live-action setting, enhanced by state-of-the-art visual effects (VFX), was a game-changer. The film takes the character's appeal and magnifies it, creating a cinematic experience that is as thrilling as it is visually stunning.

The supporting cast is equally impressive. Selina Kyle, portrayed by a charismatic actress, embodies the complex and enigmatic Catwoman. Her chemistry with Batman is palpable, and their dynamic adds depth to the story. The film also introduces a formidable antagonist in the form of the Riddler, played by an actor who brings a chilling and intellectual malevolence to the character. The way the Riddler's elaborate puzzles and clues are woven into the narrative keeps the audience engaged in a thrilling and suspenseful mystery. Whether you're a long-time Batman aficionado or a newcomer to the world of Gotham City, this film is a must-see. Batman's legend has never shone brighter on the silver screen.",the world of superhero ha alway been captiv by largerthanlif charact but none have left a indel a mark on pop cultur a the icon dark knight batman a charact belov for hi complex persona and thrill adventur ha been brought to life in variou medium but with the latest film it clear that the cape crusad ha found a new home on the big screen the batman film direct by visionari filmmak david fincher is a visual masterpiec that bring thi icon charact to life in way that have never been seen befor for someon like me whose introduct to batman came through anim seri and comic thi film wa a thrill revel i wa initi drawn to the charact through the brilliant batman the anim seri and variou comic book howev see batman in a liveact set enhanc by stateoftheart visual effect vfx wa a gamechang the film take the charact appeal and magnifi it creat a cinemat experi that is a thrill a it is visual stun the support cast is equal impress selina kyle portray by a charismat actress embodi the complex and enigmat catwoman her chemistri with batman is palpabl and their dynam add depth to the stori the film also introduc a formid antagonist in the form of the riddler play by an actor who bring a chill and intellectu malevol to the charact the way the riddler elabor puzzl and clue are woven into the narr keep the audienc engag in a thrill and suspens mysteri whether your a longtim batman aficionado or a newcom to the world of gotham citi thi film is a mustse batman legend ha never shone brighter on the silver screen,Positive

"After reading quite a few reviews from the states i was very curious about this movie. As a kid i loved to read superhero comic books, spiderman and batman were my favourites. Loving the spiderman movies and also liking the first new Batman movie by Nolan and wanting to see the last performance by Heath Ledger i couldn't wait to see this movie.

Man was i disappointed.

Don't get me wrong, i liked the movie, i had fun with it and the performance bij Heath Ledger is something i will never forget. I was sceptical about him because people tend to exaggerate performances of popular dead actors but i must honestly admit, he blew me away. He also blew every actor away he shared screen time with, i liked gary oldman best together with him in a scene. I am still wowed by Hedgers performance, and i must admit i really feel frustrated that he is gone, this performance MUST get an Oscar.

Caine was very good, Bale was OK although i don't like him as batman, he is a good Bruce Wayne but not a good batman and i really enjoyed Aaron Eckart as Harvey Dent.

But i thought the movie also had quite a few flaws.

Without giving away too much i really though most of the combat action scenes were not easily watchable because they were to fast to follow, I really didn't like the way they went with two face, and the ending sequence with the bat and the joker to me was a let down. Also i don't like the way Nolan tells the story but i must admit, thats a personal opinion.

There were 2 surprising moments that i really loved, one containing a pencil which got me laughing very hard and the other the choice sequence which ended in a way i didn't see coming but loved it.

All in all, an OK superhero movie, 7 stars but 9? come on people, that's crazy.

It's unbelievable that movies like the matrix 1 , gladiator, as good as it gets, l.a. confidential, eternal sunshine and the spotless mind don't rank as high as this movie, i cant understand it although i respect it.

"I think dark night was the best in batman trilogy for some reasons.

And one of them was brilliant act of Heath Ledger. In my opinion, the way he acts, makes the joker better than other movies and shows the joker more insane and more anarchist than ever. So he was worthy of Oscar. But sadly he was unable to receive it himself.

But I think it would be better if there was more scence of him in the movie.

", yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions.

"The Dark Knight is an extraordinary mish-mash lacking logic and cohesion.

Technically, the film is well made. That is, it looks and feels like a blockbuster, though a solid score is sorely lacking.

On the plus side, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman add gravitas to an otherwise ordinary ensemble.

And sadly, a fine actor will be remembered, not for the likes of moving and sensitive performances seen in Brokeback Mountain and Candy, but rather an excellent make-up job, an over-active tongue and a silly voice. As farewell performances rate, Heath Ledger's Joker sits alongside Peter Sellers' Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu.

"This film is a magnificent piece of work which will likely not be rivaled for years to come. The most well known antagonist in the Batman comics is undoubtedly the Joker, and Heath Ledger portrays the necessary insanity and sadism perfectly. Christian Bale as Batman leaves nothing more to be desired, and every shot of Gotham city fills you with the mystery and dread that you would expect from a city littered with crime. You can feel the sense that the city is not in a good state directly from the movie's beginning, and the Dark Knight of Gotham has to rise to the challenge. The entire plot line will pull you deeper into the movie. Every time that you think that a little scene is unimportant, there is sudden relevance to the bigger picture to Gotham.

"Some of the very first words Christian Bale utters as the eponymous role of 'soon-to-be-Batman' Bruce Wayne, in the preceding Batman film to this entitled Batman Begins, are to a thug in a remote prison located in the Far East: ""you're not The Devil, you're practise"" he hisses. The feeling's that 2008's The Dark Knight is where the practise ends and the fight with The Devil begins. This is my second crack at writing something up about the film, and while what I said initially was a little unfocused and targeted the wrong areas; I stand by the initial grade I gave it and similarly retained that similar sense of feeling underwhelmed when it finished. Even if it is deemed that The Dark Knight is one of the better comic book adaptations ever made, this is not saying a terrible lot given the bulk of entries in said film canon.

That old problem of dealing with the war genre and doing one's very best to document war as a horrid, gut-wrenching thing whilst maintaining sequences of war that cannot help but carry a sense of spectacle anyway, rears its head here. The Dark Knight documents a war on terrorism and sees Christohper Nolan attempt to echo a greater sense of things in the real world as he unleashes a character known as The Joker (Ledger) amongst the inhabitants of Gotham City, The results of his terrorist 'acts' in bringing down entire buildings allow Nolan to shoot the wreckage of said act with firefighters in the foreground and smoking rubble in the back, clearly calling on immediate 'post' imagery of the 9/11 New York attacks. Incidentally, and as one source which escapes me suggested, Joker's videos of captives held and forced to talk into video cameras evoke the actions of overseas terrorist cells, and their own methods of getting the message across to The West; while most of his scenes in which he is seen pottering around an area trying to intimidate carry an odd, distorted and erratic hand held aesthetic suggesting danger, distortion and chaos. Later on, semiology linked to fire fighting will be used again in the briefest of fashions, when a certain character, who's under threat from The Joker, is being transported in a police van: a burning fire truck is used as a blockade, and Nolan cleverly instills a further sense of victimised anguish into the audience.

In addition to biting all of this off, Nolan does his best to render the film a gangster film-come-neo noir whilst operating under this banner of a low MPAA/BBFC rating as the film additionally attempts to draw on parallels between The Joker, Batman and a third piece to the triangle in district attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart). Indeed the film opens with an audacious robbery of mob money, as perpetrated by The Joker; his menace established by the fact his cohorts contribute varying perspectives of the man whilst we perceive him to still be off screen. The robbery itself carries a clever twist in that each member kills the other when his job is done, a small but highly affecting twinge to proceedings as dreamt up by The Joker thus cementing his personality and mindset in being able to cook up something such as this. As a fighter of crime, Dent lacks the physical strength Batman does but talks a good talk and is able to place a number of criminals in jail after some hard work as he adopts his own stance on the front line of crime. Shortly afterwards, it is Gary Oldman's police lieutenant Jim Gordon whom refers to him as Gotham's ""white knight"", suggesting the man shares a similar overview to Batman's ""dark"" but is just different in technique and characteristics.

Joker's parallel with Batman sees the film establish such a relationship by way of two accompanying scenes, one seeing The Joker and a handful of representatives from Gotham's gangs occupy a kitchen and talk of certain issues. Annoyingly, the representatives are your more generic bling-wielding African-Americans; well dressed Italian American mobsters and gruff, greasy haired eastern European criminals. Cut to Gordon, Batman and Dent beside the bat signal doing the exact same thing but whose discussions and ideologies obviously differ; a later pairing of sequences seeing The Joker deal with a black criminal, whom he feels ought to be working with him, in a blunt fashion just as Batman does the same to a Chinese businessman named Lau whom he feels similarly towards in this sense, thus suggesting a more intrinsic link between the two. As is the rule of thumb in films such as Heat or American Gangster, Joker and Batman share a sequence in which they sit opposite one another at a table; on this occasion, and as other sources have stated, right before contemporary issues on the treatment of terrorists once in custody have arisen.

Where the film falls apart is its want to cater to an audience with superhero sub-genre frills, an interesting parallel drawn up between Dent as a frothing at the mouth monster named Two-Face seeking revenge and Batman, as two people differently channelling anger born out of injustices towards people they love plays out, but getting bogged down with out of sorts fight scenes and ridiculous sequences in 'sonar vision' which does nothing but juvenalise adult content. Most of the second unit stuff is nowhere near as interesting as the talk and studious observations on identity and personality; a chase through a tunnel which spills onto the streets involving a police van; a large truck and a bat-bike rather underwhelming. The film relies on rife corruption all too often to further its narrative so as to send it down another avenue of twists and turns, ultimately a story which is not as interesting as all the aforementioned character studies and power play going on as binary opposites supposedly attract and everybody's linked to each other. Ultimately only fleetingly interesting, and all too often feels bogged down.",some of the veri first word christian bale utter a the eponym role of soontobebatman bruce wayn in the preced batman film

"Iconic! ""The Dark Knight,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic tour de force that redefines the superhero genre. Released in 2008, this film stands as a testament to the transformative power of storytelling and the impact of exceptional performances. At its core, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. Ledger's posthumous Academy Award-winning performance elevates the character beyond a mere antagonist, making the Joker a symbol of chaotic brilliance and anarchy.

Christian Bale, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, brings a brooding intensity that complements the film's exploration of duality and morality. Nolan's direction is masterful, creating a gritty and realistic Gotham City that becomes a character in itself. The cinematography, coupled with Hans Zimmer's haunting score, adds layers of tension and depth to the narrative.

""The Dark Knight"" transcends the typical superhero narrative, evolving into a crime thriller that delves into the complexities of heroism. The film's social commentary on the thin line between order and chaos resonates throughout, challenging audiences intellectually and emotionally. As the capstone of Nolan's Batman trilogy, ""The Dark Knight"" sets a high standard with its thought-provoking narrative, exceptional performances, and cinematic brilliance.

This film isn't just a comic book adaptation; it's a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll. Its impact on the superhero genre is undeniable, and its legacy continues to influence filmmakers, setting a standard that few have matched.

"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight,"" released in 2008, is more than just a superhero film; it's a profound exploration of chaos, morality, and heroism, wrapped in a gripping, action-packed narrative. This film redefined the genre, setting a high bar for subsequent superhero movies and cementing its place as a cinematic classic.

At the heart of ""The Dark Knight"" is a complex narrative that delves into the dichotomy of good and evil, embodied by Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). The storyline picks up from where ""Batman Begins"" left off, with Gotham City experiencing a relative calm thanks to Batman's vigilantism. However, this peace is shattered by the emergence of the Joker, a criminal mastermind whose anarchic philosophy and unpredictable nature push Batman to his ethical and physical limits.

Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of iconic. His performance is chillingly brilliant, bringing an unsettling yet captivating energy to the screen. Ledger's Joker is not just a villain; he is chaos personified, with no discernible motive other than to create havoc. His eerie laughter, erratic behavior, and philosophical musings about the nature of mankind elevate the character beyond a mere comic book antagonist to a symbol of anarchy. Ledger's untimely death shortly after filming added a poignant layer to his performance, which was rightfully awarded a posthumous Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.

Christian Bale's Batman is equally compelling, presenting a hero burdened by the weight of his dual identity. Bale masterfully portrays the conflict within Bruce Wayne as he grapples with his sense of duty to Gotham and his personal desire for a normal life. This internal struggle is intensified by his relationships with his loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine), his confidante Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), and his love interest, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal).

Nolan's direction is meticulous, blending high-octane action sequences with deep, philosophical inquiries. The film's opening bank heist scene is a masterclass in tension and sets the tone for the ensuing chaos. The intricate plot, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is layered with themes of sacrifice, justice, and the moral ambiguities of vigilantism. The narrative's complexity is matched by Wally Pfister's cinematography, which captures the gritty realism of Gotham City, and Hans Zimmer's haunting score, which heightens the film's intense atmosphere.

One of the film's central themes is the ethical and psychological battle between Batman and the Joker. The Joker's taunting assertion that Batman's moral code is a weakness is a recurring motif, challenging the very foundation of Batman's crusade. This philosophical duel reaches its zenith in the iconic interrogation scene, where the Joker goads Batman with unsettling truths about the nature of order and chaos.

""The Dark Knight"" also explores the impact of heroism and vigilantism on society. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Gotham's ""White Knight,"" represents hope and lawful justice, but his tragic descent into Two-Face illustrates the corrupting influence of Gotham's darkness. Dent's transformation serves as a stark reminder of the thin line between heroism and villainy, a line that Batman himself must constantly navigate.

Technically, the film is a marvel. The practical effects, including the unforgettable truck flip and the jaw-dropping hospital explosion, are executed with precision, eschewing CGI in favor of real-world stunts that lend authenticity to the spectacle. Lee Smith's editing ensures a brisk pace, seamlessly weaving multiple storylines without losing narrative coherence.

""The Dark Knight"" is not merely a superhero film; it is a profound meditation on the nature of good and evil, the fragility of order, and the sacrifices required for true heroism. Its influence on the genre is undeniable, pushing the boundaries of what a comic book movie can achieve both artistically and thematically. Over a decade later, it remains a benchmark for filmmakers and a testament to the enduring power of well-crafted cinema.",christoph nolan the dark knight releas in is more than just a superhero film it a profound explor of chao moral and heroism wrap in a grip actionpack narr thi film redefin the genr set a high bar for subsequ superhero movi and cement it place a a cinemat classic at the heart of the dark knight is a complex narr that delv into the dichotomi of good and evil embodi by bruce waynebatman christian bale and the joker heath ledger the storylin pick up from where batman begin left off with gotham citi experienc a rel calm thank to batman vigilant howev thi peac is shatter by the emerg of the joker a crimin mastermind whose anarch philosophi and unpredict natur push batman to hi ethic and physic limit heath ledger portray of the joker is noth short of icon hi perform is chillingli brilliant bring an unsettl yet captiv energi to the screen ledger joker is not just a villain he is chao personifi with no discern motiv other than to creat havoc hi eeri laughter errat behavior and philosoph muse about the natur of mankind elev the charact beyond a mere comic book antagonist to a symbol of anarchi ledger untim death shortli after film ad a poignant layer to hi perform which wa right award a posthum oscar for best support actor christian bale batman is equal compel present a hero burden by the weight of hi dual ident bale master portray the conflict within bruce wayn a he grappl with hi sen of duti to gotham and hi person desir for a normal life thi intern struggl is intensifi by hi relationship with hi loyal butler alfr michael cain hi confidant luciu fox morgan freeman and hi love interest rachel daw maggi gyllenha nolan direct is meticul blend highoctan action sequenc with deep philosoph inquiri the film open bank heist scene is a masterclass in tension and set the tone for the ensu chao the intric plot cowritten by nolan and hi brother jonathan is layer with theme of sacrific justic and the moral ambigu of vigilant the narr complex is match by walli pfister cinematographi which captur the gritti realism of gotham citi and han zimmer haunt score which heighten the film intens atmospher one of the film central theme is the ethic and psycholog battl between batman and the joker the joker taunt assert that batman moral code is a weak is a recur motif challeng the veri foundat of batman crusad thi philosoph duel reach it zenith in the icon interrog scene where the joker goad batman with unsettl truth about the natur of order and chao the dark knight also explor the impact of heroism and vigilant on societi harvey dent aaron eckhart gotham white knight repres hope and law justic but hi tragic descent into twofac illustr the corrupt influenc of gotham dark dent transform serv a a stark remind of the thin line between heroism and villaini a line that batman himself must constantli navig technic the film is a marvel the practic effect includ the unforgett truck flip and the jawdrop hospit explos are execut with precis eschew cgi in favor of realworld stunt that lend authent to the spectacl lee smith edit ensur a brisk pace seamlessli weav multipl storylin without lose narr coher the dark knight is not mere a superhero film it is a profound medit on the natur of good and evil the fragil of order and the sacrific requir for true heroism it influenc on the genr is undeni push the boundari of what a comic book movi can achiev both artist and themat over a decad later it remain a benchmark for filmmak and a testament to the endur power of wellcraft cinema,Positive
"This Batman installment isn't a bad one it's just been completely overrated since the passing of Heath Ledger. Secondly there was way too much material to be packed into the three hours alloted. If anyone knows anything about the back story of Harvey Dent/Two Face they are just left feeling empty and the character itself unjustified. I understand Nolan was trying to do something different with the Joker, but why disrespect Two Face? Also, there was really no Batman/Bruce Wayne complex which I enjoy and feel is important to every Batman film. Overall a good action film, but will not be adding to my Batman movie collection. Hopefully Nolan brings back Two Face in the next film and gives him a face.",thi batman instal isnt a bad one it just been complet overr sinc the pas of heath ledger secondli there wa way too much materi to be pack into the three hour allot if anyon know anyth about the back stori of harvey denttwo face they are just left feel empti and the charact itself unjustifi i understand nolan wa tri to do someth differ with the joker but whi disrespect two face also there wa realli no batmanbruc wayn complex which i enjoy and feel is import to everi batman film overal a good action film but will not be ad to my batman movi collect hope nolan bring back two face in the next film and give him a face,Neutral

"Title: ""A Cinematic Triumph: 'The Dark Knight' Reimagines Batman Like Never Before""

Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a masterpiece of modern cinema. Released in 2008, this film marked a pivotal moment in the superhero genre, forever changing the way audiences perceive not only Batman but also the entire genre itself. With a mesmerizing blend of storytelling, unforgettable performances, and groundbreaking visuals, ""The Dark Knight"" remains an iconic achievement.

At its core, ""The Dark Knight"" is a crime drama wrapped in the guise of a superhero movie. Unlike its predecessors, this installment presents Batman as a complex vigilante facing moral dilemmas rather than a mere caped crusader fighting crime. Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman and delivers a mesmerizing performance. His portrayal is a perfect blend of brooding intensity and vulnerability, allowing the audience to empathize with the inner turmoil of the character.

However, the true standout performance in ""The Dark Knight"" is Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker. Ledger's take on the iconic Batman villain is nothing short of extraordinary. His Joker is an agent of chaos, a sadistic and unpredictable force who challenges Batman both physically and philosophically. Ledger's commitment to the role is palpable, and he disappears into the character, leaving the audience in awe of his magnetic and chilling performance. It's no exaggeration to say that Ledger's Joker is one of the most iconic and memorable villains in cinematic history.

The supporting cast also shines in their respective roles. Gary Oldman's Commissioner Gordon is the moral compass of Gotham City, and Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent is a charismatic district attorney whose transformation into Two-Face is both tragic and compelling. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine bring depth and wisdom to their characters, providing the emotional grounding needed amidst the chaos.

Nolan's direction is nothing short of visionary. He creates a dark and gritty Gotham City that feels both hauntingly realistic and heightened in its cinematic grandeur. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and shot, immersing the audience in the heart-pounding intensity of Batman's world. Nolan's use of practical effects and minimal CGI adds a tangible weight to the film's action, making every punch and explosion feel real.

One of the most remarkable aspects of ""The Dark Knight"" is its exploration of complex moral themes. The film delves into questions of justice, morality, and the nature of heroism. Batman's ethical code is put to the test as he faces the Joker's nihilistic philosophy. The film challenges the audience to consider the cost of heroism and the blurred line between hero and villain.

In addition to its thematic depth, ""The Dark Knight"" is a masterclass in storytelling. The script, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is a taut and intelligent narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The film's pacing is impeccable, with each scene building upon the last, leading to a breathtaking climax that will leave you breathless.

Hans Zimmer's score is another element that elevates ""The Dark Knight"" to a cinematic tour de force. The hauntingly beautiful music underscores the emotional beats of the film, heightening the tension and drama. Zimmer's use of recurring motifs, such as the Joker's theme, adds a layer of psychological depth to the characters.

It's worth noting that ""The Dark Knight"" is not a typical superhero film. It transcends the genre by delivering a mature and thought-provoking narrative that appeals to a broad audience. While it contains thrilling action sequences and epic battles, it also explores the human side of its characters, making it a character-driven drama that just happens to involve superheroes.

In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that redefined the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance as the Joker, and the film's exploration of complex moral themes all contribute to its status as a modern classic. It's a film that continues to resonate with audiences and stands as a testament to the power of storytelling in cinema.

"""According to what I believe, what doesn't kill a person makes him strange.""

Normally, I had no intention of watching this legend tonight. When I came across it on a TV channel, I got stuck on it. Then, when I realized how bad the dubbing was and that the movie would not be watched in this way, I turned on my 1080p format to watch the movie from the beginning without ads and in its original language.

This movie is at the beginning of very special movies for me. It is so for many people. Because in this film there is one of the most meaningful acting Deceptions among the approximately 800 films I have watched. And that's Heath Ledger. What makes it meaningful is that he died after the movie was made. He Decamped from us 6 months before the film was released. He has such a performance in this film that his Wildcard character goes into a completely different dimension. Such performances are very few. One of the biggest advantages of the film is itself. Even though I've only watched this movie, my favorites are also at the beginning.

This series has brought a completely new style and atmosphere to superhero movies. The biggest part of this is Christopher Nolan's. He is my favorite director. All his films travel on the border of legends. Except for the first one or two movies. They are not bad either, just below their own performance. The director has also assembled such a cast that it is a very difficult cast to get together again. Dec. A very wide cast, from old legends to new stars.

As a Lord Of The Rings fan, I'm saying this by putting aside the entire series. It tops the best movies I've seen. I've watched a lot of movies, but I've never seen a movie as full of every second and loaded with meaning every second as this movie. There is not the slightest superfluous scene in the film. A movie that you should keep your eyes open and watch every second. Let this movie come to cinemas again now, I'll wait at the door in the morning and go to the first session. If a movie can give both so much action and so many messages at the same time, that movie is already a legend.",accord to what i believ what doesnt kill a person make him strang normal i had no intent of watch thi legend tonight when i came across it on a tv channel i got stuck on it then when i realiz how bad the dub wa and that the movi would not be watch in thi way i turn on my p format to watch the movi from the begin without ad and in it origin languag thi movi is at the begin of veri special movi for me it is so for mani peopl becaus in thi film there is one of the most meaning act decept among the approxim film i have watch and that heath ledger what make it meaning is that he die after the movi wa made he decamp from u month befor the film wa releas he ha such a perform in thi film that hi wildcard charact goe into a complet differ dimens such perform are veri few one of the biggest advantag of the film is itself even though ive onli watch thi movi my favorit are also at the begin thi seri ha brought a complet new style and atmospher to superhero movi the biggest part of thi is christoph nolan he is my favorit director all hi film travel on the border of legend except for the first one or two movi they are not bad either just below their own perform the director ha also assembl such a cast that it is a veri difficult cast to get togeth again dec a veri wide cast from old legend to new star a a lord of the ring fan im say thi by put asid the entir seri it top the best movi ive seen ive watch a lot of movi but ive never seen a movi a full of everi second and load with mean everi second a thi movi there is not the slightest superflu scene in the film a movi that you should keep your eye open and watch everi second let thi movi come to cinema again now ill wait at the door in the morn and go to the first session if a movi can give both so much action and so mani messag at the same time that movi is alreadi a legend,Neutral

"Not a great Batman film fan because of the past films turning it into a dark farce, but I thought I would give this more serious one a go. At the start I quite enjoyed it. I like Bale and I liked the serious way of filming it where gravity did exist and the characters weren't capable of doing really stupid things, like Spiderman.

But it wasn't long before the story got a bit daft. A lot was happening that just started to ignore common sense. The story line just started to go anywhere as long as it got to the next part of the story. You constantly find yourself watching thinking ""but that wouldn't happen"".... Yeah its Batman, but when the story gets silly just to meet the outcome...well I kinda gave up on it.

The story was very...well...confusing. It kept jumping around trying to be all twisty and clever but it just made me feel aggravated. The scene jumping got madder and madder as time went on...and on...and on....

I soon found myself busting for the toilet, which got me wondering how long have I been watching this film for? This film is so bloated it is ridiculous. I kept thinking this next build up was the end...but then it just carried on. There are so many false horizons in this film it is unbelievable. This was one of those VERY rare times when I just wanted the film to end...I was begging it to end.

Hard to sum this one up, as all I wanted for it to do...was end. I stopped paying attention to the countless stupid attempts at a story twist...I just didn't care. From what I remember it was a shallow storyline that I just didn't buy into.

Now for my real moan...the high rating this film has on IMDb....evidence of more ratings corruption on this website. You used to be able to trust these film ratings but it appears that the marketing departments know exactly how to exaggerate these figures...which I find very annoying. IMDb...do something about this or risk losing your loyal visitors to this once highly regarded website.

Would I recommend this film....NO...too long and not worth the sore bum.",not a great batman film fan becaus of the past film turn it into a dark farc but i thought i would give thi more seriou one a go at the start i quit enjoy it i like bale and i like the seriou way of film it where graviti did exist and the charact werent capabl of do realli stupid thing like spiderman but it wasnt long befor the stori got a bit daft a lot wa happen that just start to ignor common sen the stori line just start to go anywher a long a it got to the next part of the stori you constantli find yourself watch think but that wouldnt happen yeah it batman but when the stori get silli just to meet the outcomewel i kinda gave up on it the stori wa verywellconfus it kept jump around tri to be all twisti and clever but it just made me feel aggrav the scene jump got madder and madder a time went onand onand on i soon found myself bust for the toilet which got me wonder how long have i been watch thi film for thi film is so bloat it is ridicul i kept think thi next build up wa the endbut then it just carri on there are so mani fals horizon in thi film it is unbeliev thi wa one of those veri rare time when i just want the film to endi wa beg it to end hard to sum thi one up a all i want for it to dowa end i stop pay attent to the countless stupid attempt at a stori twisti just didnt care from what i rememb it wa a shallow storylin that i just didnt buy into now for my real moanth high rate thi film ha on imdbevid of more rate corrupt on thi websit you use to be abl to trust these film rate but it appear that the market depart know exactli how to exagger these figureswhich i find veri annoy imdbdo someth about thi or risk lose your loyal visitor to thi onc highli regard websit would i recommend thi filmnotoo long and not worth the sore bum,Negative

"Seeing it rated as the third best movie of all time by IMDb voters, and ranking up huge box office, I thought I'd give it a swing.

I mostly wish I hadn't bothered. Like most super-hero movies nowadays, it's one gigantic battleship of a movie, weighed down by its humongous budget and massive running time. How many sub-plots do we need? How many conflicted characters, staring into the depths of their pompous souls? Visually - great. And the vfx crew have to be credited for some of the most seamless and impressive work ever done, on the city, the batmobile, the bat bike etc. Brilliant stuff.

But the story, the script, the pacing - all pretty blaah. Did I give a damn about any of the characters? Did I really care what was going to happen next? Nope. Did I actually know what was going on half the time, what with the various criminals, their money, the money laundering guy, the Joker, the various Police Departments (what the hell is ""County""?). No, no, no. Boring. I was actually looking at my watch.

The one intriguing episode in the film - with the ferries - is shoved in three quarters of the way through the film, and unceremoniously dumped once it has served its purpose in sticking other bits of the film together.

So, all in all, I wish I'd spent the time some other way.",see it rate a the third best movi of all time by imdb voter and rank up huge box offic i thought id give it a swing i mostli wish i hadnt bother like most superhero movi nowaday it one gigant battleship of a movi weigh down by it humong budget and massiv run time how mani subplot do we need how mani conflict charact stare into the depth of their pompou soul visual great and the vfx crew have to be credit for some of the most seamless and impress work ever done on the citi the batmobil the bat bike etc brilliant stuff but the stori the script the pace all pretti blaah did i give a damn about ani of the charact did i realli care what wa go to happen next nope did i actual know what wa go on half the time what with the variou crimin their money the money launder guy the joker the variou polic depart what the hell is counti no no no bore i wa actual look at my watch the one intrigu episod in the film with the ferri is shove in three quarter of the way through the film and unceremoni dump onc it ha serv it purpos in stick other bit of the film togeth so all in all i wish id spent the time some other way,Positive
"This is the future comic book adaptations are headed? THEN WATCH...ME..GO. What a sucker punch. I had such a big hopes (mostly because of the hype created by people who invested millions into this flop), that it really hurts me to say, the biggest disappointment in 2008 was this movie. (Although, I still can't say it was the worst) There is nobody I can warn about this movie since I was probably the last person to see it on the earth, But-Man, to see a great franchise falling this low?! Millions of dollars spent on this movie, could have ended the poverty on this world, and I couldn't see anything to justify the spending. For example the bat-cave, in this movie is an undecorated, plain, underground garage. Fhuy!! Batman costumes always were lacking behind other super hero's outfit, however for what they used here, I have to admit I seen better on some kids showing up at my doorstep for Halloween. Not to mention it was so uncomfortable that Christian B. couldn't even move properly in it,(heck, he couldn't even speak properly in it), so all the fight scenes were TERRIBLE, hidden in dark or under a stroboscope light. How about the gay cowboy licking his mouth every 5 seconds, scary? try Retarded (No offense) Imitating raw home made camera footage, once invented by Blair Witch Project, in a News-break part was when I almost smashed my TV. (Again, where the money went in this film???????????????????????)

I'll tell You where. Paying all the critics for a few favorable words. Shame, on You Hollywood.

Sure, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher versions were Over-The-Top, But-Man, did I love their use of colors and mood, it was a visual treat.

Dark Knight: was it a bad movie?, No, it wasn't.

"""Batman"" isn't a comic book anymore. Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is a haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy. It creates characters we come to care about. That's because of the performances, because of the direction, because of the writing, and because of the superlative technical quality of the entire production. This film, and to a lesser degree ""Iron Man,"" redefine the possibilities of the ""comic-book movie.""

""The Dark Knight"" is not a simplistic tale of good and evil. Batman is good, yes, The Joker is evil, yes. But Batman poses a more complex puzzle than usual: The citizens of Gotham City are in an uproar, calling him a vigilante and blaming him for the deaths of policemen and others. And the Joker is more than a villain. He's a Mephistopheles whose actions are fiendishly designed to pose moral dilemmas for his enemies.

The key performance in the movie is by the late Heath Ledger, as the Joker. Will he become the first posthumous Oscar winner since Peter Finch? His Joker draws power from the actual inspiration of the character in the silent classic ""The Man Who Laughs"" (1928). His clown's makeup more sloppy than before, his cackle betraying deep wounds, he seeks revenge, he claims, for the horrible punishment his father exacted on him when he was a child. In one diabolical scheme near the end of the film, he invites two ferry-loads of passengers to blow up the other before they are blown up themselves. Throughout the film, he devises ingenious situations that force Batman (Christian Bale), Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to make impossible ethical decisions. By the end, the whole moral foundation of the Batman legend is threatened.

Because these actors and others are so powerful, and because the movie does not allow its spectacular special effects to upstage the humans, we're surprised how deeply the drama affects us. Eckhart does an especially good job as Harvey Dent, whose character is transformed by a horrible fate into a bitter monster. It is customary in a comic book movie to maintain a certain knowing distance from the action, to view everything through a sophisticated screen. ""The Dark Knight"" slips around those defenses and engages us.

Yes, the special effects are extraordinary. They focus on the expected explosions and catastrophes, and have some superb, elaborate chase scenes. The movie was shot on location in Chicago, but it avoids such familiar landmarks as Marina City, the Wrigley Building or the skyline. Chicagoans will recognize many places, notably La Salle Street and Lower Wacker Drive, but director Nolan is not making a travelogue. He presents the city as a wilderness of skyscrapers, and a key sequence is set in the still-uncompleted Trump Tower. Through these heights, the Batman moves at the end of strong wires, or sometimes actually flies, using his cape as a parasail.

The plot involves nothing more or less than the Joker's attempts to humiliate the forces for good and expose Batman' secret identity, showing him to be a poser and a fraud. He includes Gordon and Dent on his target list, and contrives cruel tricks to play with the fact that Bruce Wayne once loved, and Harvey Dent now loves, Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal). The tricks are more cruel than he realizes, because the Joker doesn't know Batman's identity. Heath Ledger has a good deal of dialogue in the movie, and a lot of it isn't the usual jabs and jests we're familiar with: It's psychologically more complex, outlining the dilemmas he has constructed, and explaining his reasons for them. The screenplay by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan (who first worked together on ""Memento"") has more depth and poetry than we might have expected.",batman isnt a comic book anymor christoph nolan the dark knight is a haunt film that leap beyond it origin and becom an engross tragedi it creat charact we come to care about that becaus of the perform becaus of the direct becaus of the write and becaus of the superl technic qualiti of the entir product thi film and to a lesser degre iron man redefin the possibl of the comicbook movi the dark knight is not a simplist tale of good and evil batman is good ye the joker is evil ye but batman pose a more complex puzzl than usual the citizen of gotham citi are in an uproar call him a vigilant and blame him for the death of policeman and other and the joker is more than a villain he a mephistophel whose action are fiendishli design to pose moral dilemma for hi enemi the key perform in the movi is by the late heath ledger a the joker will he becom the first posthum oscar winner sinc peter finch hi joker draw power from the actual inspir of the charact in the silent classic the man who laugh hi clown makeup more sloppi than befor hi cackl betray deep wound he seek reveng he claim for the horribl punish hi father exact on him when he wa a child in one diabol scheme near the end of the film he invit two ferryload of passeng to blow up the other befor they are blown up themselv throughout the film he devi ingeni situat that forc batman christian bale commission gordon gari oldman and district attorney harvey dent aaron eckhart to make imposs ethic decis by the end the whole moral foundat of the batman legend is threaten becaus these actor and other are so power and becaus the movi doe not allow it spectacular special effect to upstag the human were surpris how deepli the drama affect u eckhart doe an especi good job a harvey dent whose charact is transform by a horribl fate into a bitter monster it is customari in a comic book movi to maintain a certain know distanc from the action to view everyth through a sophist screen the dark knight slip around those defens and engag u ye the special effect are extraordinari they focu on the expect explos and catastroph and have some superb elabor chase scene the movi wa shot on locat in chicago but it avoid such familiar landmark a marina citi the wrigley build or the skylin chicagoan will recogn mani place notabl la sall street and lower wacker drive but director nolan is not make a travelogu he present the citi a a wilder of skyscrap and a key sequenc is set in the stilluncomplet trump tower through these height the batman move at the end of strong wire or sometim actual fli use hi cape a a parasail the plot involv noth more or less than the joker attempt to humili the forc for good and expo batman secret ident show him to be a poser and a fraud he includ gordon and dent on hi target list and contriv cruel trick to play with the fact that bruce wayn onc love and harvey dent now love assist da rachel daw maggi gyllenha the trick are more cruel than he realiz becaus the joker doesnt know batman ident heath ledger ha a good deal of dialogu in the movi and a lot of it isnt the usual jab and jest were familiar with it psycholog more complex outlin the dilemma he ha construct and explain hi reason for them the screenplay by christoph nolan and hi brother jonathan who first work togeth on memento ha more depth and poetri than we might have expect,Positive

"In the realm of superhero movies, there exists a pinnacle of excellence that stands head and shoulders above the rest: Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. Released in 2008, this film not only redefined the genre but also transcended it, delivering a gripping narrative, stellar performances, and thought-provoking themes that continue to resonate with audiences worldwide. As an ardent fan of The Dark Knight, I am thrilled to share my enthusiastic review of this cinematic masterpiece.

From the moment the opening scene unfolds, The Dark Knight captivates viewers with its atmospheric cinematography and haunting score. Nolan's Gotham City is a gritty and realistic backdrop, evoking a sense of urban decay and moral ambiguity. This serves as the perfect setting for the complex character dynamics that drive the story forward.

At the heart of The Dark Knight lies the conflict between the iconic hero Batman, portrayed with unparalleled gravitas by Christian Bale, and his enigmatic adversary, the Joker, brought to life in a chillingly mesmerizing performance by Heath Ledger. Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary, as he embodies the chaotic nature of the character with an intensity and unpredictability that is both captivating and unnerving. Every scene featuring the Joker crackles with tension, as he challenges Batman's moral code and pushes him to his limits.

But The Dark Knight is not merely a showdown between hero and villain; it is a deep exploration of the nature of heroism, justice, and the human psyche. The film delves into complex themes such as morality, sacrifice, and the blurred line between good and evil. Batman, burdened by the weight of his crusade against crime, must confront the darker aspects of his own identity as he battles against the Joker's nihilistic worldview.

One of the most compelling aspects of The Dark Knight is its examination of the concept of chaos versus order. The Joker represents pure chaos, an agent of anarchy who seeks to disrupt the established order and expose the hypocrisy of society. In contrast, Batman embodies the ideal of order and justice, striving to uphold a sense of morality and stability in the face of chaos. The dynamic between these two opposing forces drives much of the film's narrative tension, culminating in a series of gripping confrontations that challenge both characters on a fundamental level.

Beyond its thematic depth, The Dark Knight also excels in its technical craftsmanship. Nolan's direction is masterful, with each scene meticulously crafted to build tension and suspense. The action sequences are pulse-pounding and adrenaline-fueled, showcasing Batman's prowess as a formidable crimefighter. The film's visual effects are seamlessly integrated, immersing viewers in the dark and brooding atmosphere of Gotham City.

Furthermore, The Dark Knight boasts a stellar supporting cast, including standout performances from Aaron Eckhart as the idealistic district attorney Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as the steadfast Commissioner Gordon, and Morgan Freeman as the wise and resourceful Lucius Fox. Each actor brings depth and nuance to their respective roles, adding layers of complexity to the film's ensemble cast.

As a fan of The Dark Knight, I am continually impressed by its enduring legacy and cultural impact. More than a decade after its release, the film remains a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. Its themes of heroism, sacrifice, and the struggle for justice are as relevant today as they were upon its initial release.

In conclusion, The Dark Knight stands as a shining example of cinematic excellence, a film that transcends the confines of its genre to deliver a powerful and thought-provoking experience. From its gripping storyline to its unforgettable performances, Christopher Nolan's masterpiece is a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring appeal of the superhero mythos.

The performance of his life. ( no pun intended ). Its a shame he died, there were more great performances in him, sadly we will never see.

"Sorry guys, but this doesn't belong in the top 250's by any account. Its fight scenes, car chases, its effects, and its storyline were all mostly average. Momentum wasn't built up over the film at all, and worse, they dragged out scenes longer then they should have.

In fact, this movie was in the top 250 list BEFORE it made it to cinema. Why? Because there are a few people who are overly enthusiastic about batman who used Heath's death as a marketing tool, over-hyped the movie and voted it upwards despite never having seen it. Just because a movie is based on a comic shouldn't mean it should be voted any differently (would anyone have liked this movie if Batman's costume was swapped). Yes, heath was good because he played something out of his general character, similar to how Jim Carrey did in Spotless mind. But...

"""The Dark Knight"" goes far beyond the label of a blockbuster or action film. Christopher Nolan crafts a powerful cinematic experience, confronting audiences with ethical and psychological dilemmas that stretch beyond the genre's conventions. Right from the start, the film challenges us to follow Batman in a struggle that goes beyond physical fights, diving deep into the dark territory of moral choices. More than a simple hero-villain face-off, Nolan shows just how much Bruce Wayne is driven-not by glory-but by a compulsive need to do what's right in a world where ""right"" is increasingly ambiguous. At its core, the film explores complex themes like sacrifice, surveillance, and the price of morality, redefining what to expect from a superhero adaptation.

The backbone of ""The Dark Knight"" is the dynamic between Batman and the Joker, portrayed iconically by Heath Ledger. Ledger's Joker is utterly disturbing, driven by a logic-defying impulse to expose humanity's fragility. This Joker embodies chaos in its purest form, revealing and manipulating Gotham's and Batman's vulnerabilities. More than an antagonist, he's a chaotic force that pushes Batman to question his own values, forcing him to confront the moral shadows of his own actions. The Joker imposes impossible dilemmas on Gotham and Batman alike, serving as a twisted mirror for Bruce Wayne's limitations and the clash between justice and obsession.

Christian Bale gives a gritty performance, turning Bruce Wayne into one of cinema's most complex characters. Instead of a perfect hero, his Batman is a man exhausted, torn between his commitment to protect Gotham and the personal toll of that mission. Bale brings a physicality to the role, using a raspy, intense voice under the cowl to express Batman's psychological weight. He masterfully balances the carefree playboy persona with the brooding vigilante, underscoring that Bruce is as masked in public as he is in the cape. In his interactions with the Joker, Bale conveys a complex mix of anger, frustration, and vulnerability, making him a powerful hero who struggles and wears down like anyone in Gotham. Bale's raw authenticity makes his Batman unforgettable, pushing beyond the superhero archetype into a movingly human portrayal.

The urban setting of Gotham becomes another main character, with a darkly realistic design heightened by cinematography that avoids over-the-top visuals while retaining the city's oppressive identity. Gotham is a battlefield where fear and corruption touch every scene, reflecting the complex morality of its residents. Each shot is carefully crafted to create a space where Batman is a dark vigilante and paradoxically vulnerable, as if the very place constantly reminds him of the impossibility of eradicating evil completely. Nolan makes Gotham a believable city where heroism meets real-world barriers, adding to the thick, intense atmosphere throughout the film.

Bruce Wayne's moral journey is heightened when he sees hope in Harvey Dent, believing him capable of carrying the weight of justice without turning to darkness. Aaron Eckhart plays Dent with idealistic energy that slowly breaks under pressure and tragedy, showing the fall of a ""White Knight"" into a haunting Two-Face. The story carefully parallels Dent's downfall with Batman's sacrifices, suggesting that even the purest heroes can be corrupted by pain and loss. This duality between Bruce and Dent deepens the story, and instead of simplifying the hero-villain theme, it builds complex characters who shift between light and shadow, highlighting the real cost of justice.

Nolan boldly takes on contemporary ethical questions, like surveillance and power boundaries, exploring just how far security can justify the loss of privacy. Batman's use of mass surveillance technology to catch the Joker raises the ends-versus-means debate. This decision creates one of the movie's most crucial conflicts, with Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) acting as a moral compass, challenging Batman's methods. The clash between safety and ethics lends the film a relevance that resonates beyond fiction, sparking reflections on society and the role of power in protection or oppression. Nolan's choice to include this conversation elevates ""The Dark Knight"" from action flick to critical commentary, raising questions that stick with viewers.

Technically, the film is flawless, with Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enriching the atmosphere with tension and emotional depth. The sound design is especially effective in Joker scenes, marked by a sharp, ominous sound that builds sinister anticipation before he even speaks. The action scenes, executed with realism and precision, are dynamic and visually impactful without overshadowing the plot or characters, always advancing the story. Nolan strategically uses every technical element to heighten the narrative, immersing viewers in Bruce Wayne's moral struggle-a vigilante constantly torn between his principles and actions.

In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" transcends the superhero genre by diving into themes of morality, sacrifice, and humanity's darker side. Nolan drives a narrative that challenges audiences to see beyond the battle of good versus evil, questioning the cost of being a hero in a world where justice and ethics often clash. Batman's final image, bearing Gotham's sins and fading into the shadows, is one of cinema's most iconic and melancholy shots, capturing the weight of his burden and the complexity of his role. Ultimately, the film stands as a masterpiece that redefines genre expectations, leaving a lasting mark on both superhero films and the cinematic landscape.",the dark knight goe far beyond the label of

"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a towering achievement in the realm of superhero cinema, transcending genre conventions to deliver a gripping and thought-provoking exploration of heroism, morality, and the nature of chaos. With its complex characters, thrilling action sequences, and profound themes, this film captivates audiences from beginning to end, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern cinema.

At the heart of ""The Dark Knight"" is Heath Ledger's mesmerizing performance as the Joker, one of the most iconic villains in cinematic history. Ledger's portrayal is nothing short of legendary, capturing the anarchic spirit of the character with a chilling intensity and magnetic charisma. His Joker is a force of nature, a chaotic agent who seeks to upend the established order and expose the hypocrisy and corruption that lurk beneath the surface of society.

Opposite Ledger's Joker stands Christian Bale's Batman, a brooding and conflicted figure grappling with his own inner demons and the moral complexities of his crusade against crime. Bale brings a quiet intensity to the role, imbuing Batman with a sense of gravitas and depth that grounds the film amidst its larger-than-life spectacle.

But ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a battle between hero and villain; it's a nuanced exploration of the blurred lines between good and evil, order and chaos. Nolan deftly weaves together multiple narrative threads, from the escalating conflict between Batman and the Joker to the ethical dilemmas faced by Gotham's law enforcement and political elite. The result is a film that is as intellectually stimulating as it is viscerally thrilling, challenging audiences to grapple with the complexities of morality and justice in a world plagued by corruption and violence.

Of course, ""The Dark Knight"" is also a technical marvel, with breathtaking action sequences, stunning visual effects, and a haunting score by Hans Zimmer that heightens the film's sense of tension and unease. Every frame is meticulously crafted, from the towering skyscrapers of Gotham City to the shadowy alleyways where the Dark Knight prowls.

In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a superhero movie; it's a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre to become a timeless work of art. Whether you're a fan of comic books or not, this is a film that demands to be seen and appreciated for its bold storytelling, impeccable craftsmanship, and profound thematic depth.",christoph nolan the dark knight stand a a tower achiev in the realm of superhero cinema transcend genr convent to deliv a grip and thoughtprovok explor of heroism moral and the natur of chao with it complex charact thrill action sequenc and profound theme thi film captiv audienc from begin to end leav an indel mark on the landscap of modern cinema at the heart of the dark knight is heath ledger mesmer perform a the joker one of the most icon villain in cinemat histori ledger portray is noth short of legendari captur the anarch spirit of the charact with a chill intens and magnet charisma hi joker is a forc of natur a chaotic agent who seek to upend the establish order and expo the hypocrisi and corrupt that lurk beneath the surfac of societi opposit ledger joker stand christian bale batman a brood and conflict figur grappl with hi own inner demon and the moral complex of hi crusad against crime bale bring a quiet intens to the role imbu batman with a sen of gravita and depth that ground the film amidst it largerthanlif spectacl but the dark knight is more than just a battl between hero and villain it a nuanc explor of the blur line between good and evil order and chao nolan deftli weav togeth multipl narr thread from the escal conflict between batman and the joker to the ethic dilemma face by gotham law enforc and polit elit the result is a film that is a intellectu stimul a it is viscer thrill challeng audienc to grappl with the complex of moral and justic in a world plagu by corrupt and violenc of cours the dark knight is also a technic marvel with breathtak action sequenc stun visual effect and a haunt score by han zimmer that heighten the film sen of tension and uneas everi frame is meticul craft from the tower skyscrap of gotham citi to the shadowi alleyway where the dark knight prowl in the end the dark knight is more than just a superhero movi it a cinemat masterpiec that transcend it genr to becom a timeless work of art whether your a fan of comic book or not thi is a film that demand to be seen and appreci for it bold storytel impecc craftsmanship and profound themat depth,Neutral
"The Dark Knight was most definitely one of the better movies I've had the pleasure of viewing and it did not fail to meet any preconceived notions or ideas which I formed already. Everything, from the phenomenal performance of the gifted set of actors to the amazing stunts and action executed, was beautifully and concisely produced. Starting with the actors and their performance, I believe that Heath Ledger was the best Joker the Batman Universe has yet to see; his expressed nuances and habits that he evokes to portray the Joker are something to be marveled. In one of the most famous scenes of not just the movie but of cinematic history, Heath Ledger poses the question to a mob leader while holding him at knife point: Why so serious? Heath Ledger was one of the best casting jobs of the movie. Another good casting job of the movie is of Christian Bale's. He plays Bruce Wayne/ Batman in The Dark Knight and he brings the mystery and reclusiveness and charisma that he embodies as both personalities. However, while I sing praises of the movie thus far, I don't feel as though it deserves a 10 of 10 as a score. There is a little amount of movie material that can be considered worthy of such a score and The Dark Knight is no exception.

"One word: Amazing. Not much to say besides that.

Christopher Nolan brings us a new Batman against joker story that takes the title for best.

The idea that Batman can't do anything. The idea that joker is the best criminal.

Heath Ledger was amazing.

You're on the edge of your seat the entire time.

There are only two things I'm complaining about and that stopped me from rating it a 10.

"The Dark Knight is one of those movies that resonate in people so much that they are a true and avid believer in the Joker & Batman himself. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The only way the joker can see himself as credible is if he does things his way, without hesitation. The Batman is his nemesis & does everything he can to stop him. The bat mobile is the perfect example of why the cutting edge tech in this movie is still viable to this day and the future ahead. I see myself in the Joker and I also see myself in the Batman. Much training was necessary for the Batman to fully evolve into the walking bat-suited mastermind himself.

"When I read the enthusiastic reviews in Italy and I saw this movie ranked 1st in the IMDb's Top 250, I thought: ""It's strange, the other Batman (Begins) was not so brilliant, what's happening with this sequel? Is it really this masterpiece? Is it really in the same league with movies like 'Clockwork Orange' or 'Apocalypse now'?"". No, it's not in the same league. Not at all. When I saw it, my delusion was strong. It's a good blockbuster action movie, but nothing more. Let's see.

The following comments contain spoilers. Be careful.

The script is not so original. There are tons of action sequences, but what can I say? I've seen it all. I've seen the robbery made by violent people, fighting against the guards and killing each others (in all pulp tradition, since ""Reservoir Dogs""). I've seen the ransom in China by plane (""Spy Games""). I've seen those action sequences with cars and armored vehicles in all American movies. (And this Batmobile is really awkward). I've seen the killer who kills by chance (""No Country for Old Men""). I've seen the super-mega-sadistic-mad-chaotic-evil-serial-killer in action who creates dilemmas and plays with his victims (in ""Seven"" and in the ""Saw"" saga). I've seen it all: ""The Dark Knight"" is nothing new. And it's very predictable: you really can predict any sequence before seeing it. There are a lot of absurdities. The heroes could kill The Joleker dozens of times, but they never do it. Why? Are they retarded? The ""two ships dilemma"" (I don't want to reveal more about that scene) is not realistic at all. There are only a couple of surprises, but the 2/3 of the movie doesn't create any suspense. What about the actors? The only two heroes of acting in this movie are Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart. Heath Ledger, with his Joker, bears quite the entire movie. All the other characters became secondary. Aaron Eckhart is really powerful and he confirms his talent shown in ""Thank You for Smoking"". What about the others? Christian Bale is one of the most talented actors of his generation, but in this movie he keeps only one expression all the time, with or without mask. His Batman has no personality. Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of the most interesting (and underrated) independent actresses of the New Hollywood, since ""The Secretary"". But in this movie she can act only in few sequences and she has no chance to show her real talent. Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane are giants, but in this movie they barely appear. Finally: I've never seen so many waste of talent! The good side of the coin in Christopher Nolan's work is: his philosophy. It's really positive and constructive and all his movie is coherent about it. It's just like the positive answer to ""No Country for Old Men"" and to modern nihilism: in the Cohen's movie, Evil is the absence of values and it's unstoppable. In ""The Dark Knight"", Evil is again the absence of values, but it's a minority, not the rule. So, we can fight Evil and defeat it, with or without super-heroes. But all those themes could be and should be explored better. ""The Dark Knight"" explores nothing.",when i read the enthusiast review in itali and i saw thi movi rank st in the imdb top i thought it strang the other batman begin wa not so brilliant what happen with thi sequel is it realli thi masterpiec is it realli in the same leagu with movi like clockwork orang or apocalyps now no it not in the same leagu not at all when i saw it my delus wa strong it a good blockbust action movi but noth more let see the follow comment contain spoiler be care the script is not so origin there are ton of action sequenc but what can i say ive seen it all ive seen the robberi made by violent peopl fight against the guard and kill each other in all pulp tradit sinc reservoir dog ive seen the ransom in china by plane spi game ive seen those action sequenc with car and armor vehicl in all american movi and thi batmobil is realli awkward ive seen the killer who kill by chanc no countri for old men ive seen the supermegasadisticmadchaoticevilserialkil in action who creat dilemma and play with hi victim in seven and in the saw saga ive seen it all the dark knight is noth new and it veri predict you realli can predict ani sequenc befor see it there are a lot of absurd the hero could kill the jolek dozen of time but they never do it whi are they retard the two ship dilemma i dont want to reveal more about that scene is not realist at all there are onli a coupl of surpris but the of the movi doesnt creat ani suspens what about the actor the onli two hero of act in thi movi are heath ledger and aaron eckhart heath ledger with hi joker bear quit the entir movi all the other charact becam secondari aaron eckhart is realli power and he confirm hi talent shown in thank you for smoke what about the other christian bale is one of the most talent actor of hi gener but in thi movi he keep onli one express all the time with or without mask hi batman ha no person maggi gyllenha is one of the most interest and underr independ actress of the new hollywood sinc the secretari but in thi movi she can act onli in few sequenc and she ha no chanc to show her real talent morgan freeman and michael cane are giant but in thi movi they bare appear final ive never seen so mani wast of talent the good side of the coin in christoph nolan work is hi philosophi it realli posit and construct and all hi movi is coher about it it just like the posit answer to no countri for old men and to modern nihil in the cohen movi evil is the absenc of valu and it unstopp in the dark knight evil is again the absenc of valu but it a minor not the rule so we can fight evil and defeat it with or without superhero but all those theme could be and should be explor better the dark knight explor noth,Positive
"It surprises me that 12 years has passed since this film was released, and no other film of the super-hero genre have surpassed this one in terms of quality. Not one of the MCU, neither of the DCEU. Of course, we had great super-heroes films, but the Dark Knight have something else. I think it's the philosophical part. Not trying to be 'deep' or play the smart one, it's just the part that captivated me the most. The idea of Batman being the 'ugly hero', the monologue of Gordon in the ending of the film is outstanding and one of the reason I love Batman. Joker, that is heavily based on the version of the graphic novel Killing Joke of Alan Moore. The agent of chaos and anarchy that have a twisted vision of the world. The 'madness is like gravity' phrase have the same concept of this quote of The Killing Joke ""All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day."" Of course there's more than that, I loved Harvey Dent, Joker's 'social experiment' moment is just so powerful. The concept of a hero defeating the villain not with punchs and kicks, but proving that his view of world and ideology are both wrong, is just fantastic and I knew Christopher Nolan wouldn't gave us less than that.

About the rest, that makes this film even more interesting. Of course Nolan's directing, he's not that good at action sequences, but nothing you can't ignore. The amazing soundtrack of Hans Zimmer, his music brings the build-up necessary to increase the tension and adds more emotions to the film's most memorable moments. There's much more things that makes this film so great, but the charm is without doubt Heath Ledger's acting, a groundbreaking perfomance, he steals every scene he's in, he's charismatic, even portraying a sociopath, his laugh, the mannerisms, everything about his character is great. One of the few comic book films that are a masterpiece, but if they all were this good, gems like this film wouldn't as relevant as it is.",it surpris me that year ha pas sinc thi film wa releas and no other film of the superhero genr have surpass thi one in term of qualiti not one of the mcu neither of the dceu of cours we had great superhero film but the dark knight have someth el i think it the philosoph part not tri to be deep or play the smart one it just the part that captiv me the most the idea of batman be the ugli hero the monologu of gordon in the end of the film is outstand and one of the reason i love batman joker that is heavili base on the version of the graphic novel kill joke of alan moor the agent of chao and anarchi that have a twist vision of the world the mad is like graviti phrase have the same concept of thi quot of the kill joke all it take is one bad day to reduc the sanest man aliv to lunaci that how far the world is from where i am just one bad day of cours there more than that i love harvey dent joker social experi moment is just so power the concept of a hero defeat the villain not with punch and kick but prove that hi view of world and ideolog are both wrong is just fantast and i knew christoph nolan wouldnt gave u less than that about the rest that make thi film even more interest of cours nolan direct he not that good at action sequenc but noth you cant ignor the amaz soundtrack of han zimmer hi music bring the buildup necessari to increas the tension and add more emot to the film most memor moment there much more thing that make thi film so great but the charm is without doubt heath ledger act a groundbreak perfom he steal everi scene he in he charismat even portray a sociopath hi laugh the manner everyth about hi charact is great one of the few comic book film that are a masterpiec but if they all were thi good gem like thi film wouldnt a relev a it is,Positive

""" You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain""

Opening with a cunning master-show; a blisteringly devious bank heist that gives us the most iconic villain ever to grace the screen. A creepy Glasgow smile that keeps us up at night, spooking, haunting and endlessly projecting in our psyches for years and years, echoing from generation through generation. Everything holds up so well, in fact too well. The Dark Knight is a monolithic milestone of vigilante epicness, a hard-boiled crime noir masquerading as a PG-13 superhero movie, and a heroic ode for the ages.

Clap, Clap, Clap (in Joker's manner) for Nolan's ballistic nihilism, no holds barred mannerism and his spectacular vision has bequeathed us with multiple moral time-bombs, finely-tuned characterizations and dynamically explosive set-pieces: fake Batmans sequence, Harvey vs Rachel, 18-wheeler truck spinning and flipping upside down and Joker's brazenly blasting at the Batpod and so on. The villains have largely overpowered our hero in this one as darkness triumphantly cloaks up daylight, subverting the very foundation of comic-book genre, showing something we haven't seen before.

Similar to that magic pencil, The Dark Knight is relentless with its freakishly brutal power, casting an Abracadabra that's capable of knocking you out, mind-blown and ice cold on the floor. Dark and somber but equally rich in aesthetics, rainy Gotham City is as beautiful as it is immersive. So bleak there's almost no hope left and tensions are boisterously fueled by atmospheric dangers looming near, mercilessly raising the stakes up to 10000 degrees Celsius blazing fire. With many maze-like twists possessing such unpredictable nature similar to its crazy antagonist(s), this showdown is twistedly deranged, exciting and tragic in equal measures.

A film, so monumental, its impact cannot be understated. A film as bold and as ever-lasting as the immortal name it so tragically tells the story of.

An untouchable piece of fiction that brings great life to decades of graphic novel story-telling in unfathomably ground-breaking fashion. This is the power of undisputed directing champ Christopher Nolan.

He's Not Our Hero.

He's A Silent Guardian.

A Watchful Protector.

"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there.",weve been subject to enorm amount of hype and market for the dark knight weve seen joker scaveng hunt and one of the largest viral campaign in advertis histori and it culmin with the actual releas of the movi everyth that been said is pretti much spot on thi is the first time i can rememb where a summer blockbust film far surpass the hype for a much action a there is in thi movi it the act that make it a great piec of work between all the punch explos and stuntwork is some great dialog work all the actor have their moment bale batman is the definit batman becaus we see everyth in thi charact final on film martial art skill cun great tactic think forens applic technolog geniu to advanc or improv lusciou fox inventionstechnolog breakthrough intimid person and even a littl swashbuckl a for heath ye he get credit for hi perform a the joker but you have to also recogn jonathan and chri nolan for the write and treatment of the charact it not just the fact that ledger make the joker so menac but the nolan have given the charact thi great manifesto that drive it action the joker stanc on chao order anarchi the moral of the averag modern human be make the charact so interest psycholog the nolan draft a complex charact and onli a perfect perform couldv pull someth like thi off that how difficult of a role thi wa and that whi ledger perform is so great thi isnt an action movi it a film that explor literari theme of the hero and villain a well a order and anarchi ye listen to the dialog becaus it all in there,Neutral
"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script.

A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class.

"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience.

"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.

The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote.

"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger.

"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home.

"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.

"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film.

"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10.",the actor the script the sceneri make it one of the best movi i have ever seen the bestplay charact of the joker is amaz that how i imagin him in the film he is portray a an ultraintellig person with a psychopath brain honestli i wa veri surpris that someon known for their nich product would play such a good role a one of the most import charact in the batman seri unfortun we will probabl never see the joker so well again becaus heath ledger from unknown circumst die thi is sad news howev back to the movi the main charact batman play by christian bale also show the charact veri well therefor my rate for thi movi is,Neutral
"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.

Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.

Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.

And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.

The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made.",when i went to the cinema to see indiana jone i rememb see a trailer for the dark knight it wa dark full of explos and look realli cool be a huge fan of batman and the two burton film i couldnt wait to see it while i never saw it in cinema i rememb my friend tell me it wa amaz and one of the best film ever fast forward to when i final got to see the film and it wa a differ stori two and a half hour of the most pretenti bore and disappoint film i had ever seen let start with the plot basic the joker atleast that what they call him start kill peopl and caus mayhem mean batman ha to stop him sound simpl but the film spoil thi by have too mani plot line most of which have noth to do with the actual plot dont last long enough to be interest and could have been easili cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot now for the hero and villain batman is play by christian bale and come complet with an over the top gruff voic which sound like he smoke a entir packet of cigarett while do a cross countri marathon he nowher near a dark or a intimid a keaton batman and isnt veri engag a bruce either now for the reason the film is consid to be so great heath ledger a the joker ledger is the main drive point of the film and the most interest charact he play the role veri convincingli and ill admit is the best part of the film even though they could have call him anyth el instead of the joker and it would have been the same and that my biggest problem with thi film it doesnt feel like a batman film batman ha alway been a surreal franchis mean it walk on a line between the real world and a fantasi world whi doe gotham citi just look like and regular citi whi doe the joker not have ani comic death contrapt whi doe the batmobil look like a tank where are all batman uniqu gadget the problem is nolan doesnt understand that a man who dress up a a bat and fight crime cant be taken complet serious burton made a surreal world for batman and batman return creat a perfect environ for hi film but with nolan all i think of is just a crime drama with batman in it the joker could have been just a psycho with makeup the pace is also a flaw sometim the film move too quickli for u to digest what go on and other time it goe to slow that we lose interest onli reason peopl love it wa for heath ledger amaz perform and hi unfortun pas away befor the film releas and even that doesnt fit the bill for a batman movi to sum up the dark knight will go down in histori a the most overr film ever made,Negative
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'.",batman take on the crime lord with the help of lieuten jim gordon and district attorney harvey dent howev an even bigger evil rise to terror gotham maggi gyllenha is an improv over kati holm a rachel daw aaron eckhart add a good perform a harvey dent in the end thi is heath ledger movi he overpow everybodi hi earli death may have immort him but my opinion isnt inflat hi presenc is electr it help that hi charact is so ridicul crazi hi motiv ha noth to do with power or money which is so mundan he want chao and that is so much more fascin heath ledger make thi movi great and it surpass the seri reboot batman begin,Neutral

"I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.

This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.

I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).

There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.

I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up.

"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.

As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.

The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.

Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans.

"This Is probably the second best sequel of all time, second only to the return of the king. I've seen this movie twice in cinema this year, that's just how good it is. I could name very few flaws in this movie. This movie has some of the best preformances of all time. Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film. However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as two-face to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers. Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times.

"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.

This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.

Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.

The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.

There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.

No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come.

"Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received.",heath ledger a the joker is brilliant and anytim he on the screen thi action film seem elev it also get the nihilist insan of the charact right a alfr michael cain so correctli put it some men just want to watch the world burn i wa less of a fan of christian bale perform a batman with hi toneless gruff voic and if im honest even the concept of the dark knight with batman san robin view a an evil vigilant by the citizen of gotham i also thought the film tri to pack too much in with the love interesttriangl maggi gyllenha rise of two face aaron eckhart and extran charact eg morgan freeman it could have also use a breather in between all the action scene though some of the element like that batpod with the extra fat tire were pretti cool it goe on way too long at minut and if it had been pare down and more focus on the joker sadist psycholog cruelti could have been a masterpiec all in all it a good entertain film but not worthi of the extraordinari high prais and rate it receiv,Positive
"In my opinion, this movie a bit over-hyped and a bit over-rated actually. Is this movie better than 12 Angry Men or Schindler's List or The Return Of The King? Absoulutely not. Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted. This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger.

"There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.

A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!

The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?

Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.

The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.

Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.

Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!

Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.

As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!",there is just one thing that differenti a legend from ordinari man it hi fight with inner demon to over come all hi fear that defin a legend and thi is what batman stand for batman is not just anoth comic charact but it a complet saga of how you stand tall in spite of lose everyth walk fearlessli even when you are lone and how you fight back against all odd and over shadow your own fear fear the most domin emot mankind ha ever wit batman is no except he still ha fear he still get scare of lose those who are close to him and he is still in doubt when it come to decis but what is interest and inspir about batman is that he ha the abil to use wise the biggest and most danger weapon of all time perfectli brain that whi he is my favourit comic charact and thi time batman is put everyth on the line to save the world from out of control freak the joker a spell bound perform by heath ledger a the joker though he is no more with u but hi immort act a joker is an oscar win perform and will alway be rememb your heart come out to mouth to see the horror joker creat in start i wa bit confus a hi perform remind me of jack nicholson from the first batman movi but later i realis that thi is for real he did not imit jack but showcas the true and horribl side of a real joker the best part about heath is that he display the flip side of a joker fearless there are mani time when we feel that some one could have done better with certain role but not here here heath is perfect a a joker and from now on i will call him heath joker ledger the stori is about a terror that ha shaken the underworld of gotham the fear of batman is get in to crimin mind and all of them are now think where their money can be save from batman reach and that where the joker come with a plan to these crimin kill batman now with hi pervert mind the joker is behind batman life and what follow is a scari hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith v courag at one end joker ha no fear and on the other batman ha a respons of save gotham now the import question is that who will win and more than that at what cost apart from break box offic record thi movi is also abl to break the pattern of film make batman seri is an action seri when you make an action movi you give the requir pace in a movi by focus on elabor the action scene but here the director build the movi with a mix of action a well a other emot scene step by step movi give it audienc action and emot at the time when it requir but with an unexpect style dark intens and a complet batman style the batman movi are famou for it back ground music and the dark knight is no except special when there is sound of a whistl in background of some intens scene in the movi i felt a rush in to my blood and boil my brain my eye pop out while watch those scene to mention batman grill session with the joker is a masterpiec the scene wa simpli awesom mainli coz of background music harvey dent charact could have been better post he becom face i wa expect hi charact to be more involv and longer in the seri rachel daw is also a veri strong influenc charact in the movi her involv in the movi is much focus than kati holm in batman begin but the point im make here is the glam factor in thi movi she wa not given that much footag in a glamor way nevertheless the plot did not allow audienc to think that way either action scene in thi movi are well thought of and will chill the audienc spinal chord my favourit is the chase scene where joker is tri best to catch harvey dent and how batman come in between thi is where batman say asta la vista and welcom hi new girl friend hi damn new bike it call batpod i can imagin how excit you will be when you know that batman is now go to catch the joker and joker is happi that batman ha miss hi shot thi is sheer delight to watch the creativ involv of special effect blend with brilliant cinematographi unlik other hollywood flick the dark knight is a lengthi movi of more than ½ hr of nonstop adrenalin but you wont mind spend that much time watch it mani time we feel that some movi couldv been shorter and some lengthier but with the dark knight that not the case it mainli becaus the movi end up at the time when it is requir to scroll the curtain down i wa so satisfi while come out from the movi hall perfect end well the dark knight is just a begin now im expect the penguin and the riddler to come in to the pictur and take thi battl ahead a i said earlier im a big fan of batman and after thi movi im mad about not just batman but each and everi part of hi movi music and the joker now while im rush straight to the nearest movi store to buy all origin movi and soundtrack of batman seri you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the joker or batman choic is your,Positive

One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight, despite these movies being in a series.

"Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.

Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.

I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.

This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.

Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.

I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.

Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice.

"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all.",it is odd to spend more than two hour watch a film and it slowli dawn on you that you are not particularli bother how it end and if anyth rather wish it would end sooner rather than later the dark knight is that kind of film exactli whi i lost interest or even when im not too sure but lose interest i did thi is christoph nolan second stab at batman a well a christian rant bale and although all the element are there it is simpli not a good natur thi be anoth slug blast and punchfest tho despit it reput for be dark thank not a bloodfest mani mani viewer have laud thi a a masterpiec the best movi of so far far surpass begin no it isnt and no it doesnt all i can say is that these peopl have not seen mani masterpiec or mani film in the dark knight in that way which hollywood ha made it sugari own attempt to flatter the audienc by includ a moral dilemma and it doe so not onc but rather often thi time we are invit the we be the popcornchew saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxuri to reflect on moral ambigu and how rel rather than absolut the notion of good and evil can be and each time thi viewer sigh a littl a the say goe you can put lipstick on a pig but it is still a pig we get ani number of high falutin speech about hero and villain but in truth is just so much codswallop in truth thi film is just anoth blockbust and at that it is not even a good a mani other blockbust if you want to medit on the realiti of good and evil of hero and villain by all mean make a film do so but in the dark knight it is all for thi viewer at least all veri phoney apart from that thi film is a tad confus there are too mani charact the plot or at least what there is of it realli doe not bear repeat the suspens is curious unexcit and too often the film drag the old actor are there and all with the veri honour except of the late heath ledger seem to be act by number thi wa i think ledger last film and hi earli death is sad undoubtedli he wa veri talent and have said all that there is not much more to say it not bad it not particularli good a part of the seri it stand tall but then the seri is not all that outstand see it if you want to and if after read thi you decid not to well sorri but you wont be miss much at all,Neutral

"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil. Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down. To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas. It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in.

"When Batman Begins was released in the year 2005, I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series, that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny, playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of Batman..

So when I went to watch this movie, I was ready to see the Heath Ledger's Joker cracking some jokes, blowing up lots of places, killing tons of people, going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..

Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work..

Other actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully.

This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, For those of you who haven't watched it yet, I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely..",when batman begin wa releas in the year i watch it and wonder see the end scene where the joker wa reveal to be the villain in the next instal of the seri that well how christoph nolan is gonna incorpor the funni play and complet insan charact of the joker in to hi dark and seriou version of batman so when i went to watch thi movi i wa readi to see the heath ledger joker crack some joke blow up lot of place kill ton of peopl go way beyond insan and of cours laugh a lot but the joker i saw wa rather just the opposit he did blow up build he did kill peopl he did go insan and laugh but he did all of thi with a motiv and a touch of control and calm to it it been a while sinc i have seen a movi where the villain shine more than the hero and in thi movi heath ledger joker complet stole the show everyth he doe seem reason and the thing that he say feel honest and true the movi grip you throughout it min runtim christoph nolan nail it and show how comic book charact can be taken out of their color world put in a dark and seriou movi and make it work other actor also play their part well christian bale wa good a batmanbruc wayn aaron eckhart wa brilliant a harvey dent gari oldman maggi gyllenha michael cain and morgan freeman play their role beauti thi movi is one of my favorit movi of all time for those of you who havent watch it yet i recommend you watch it a soon a possibl becaus thi kind of gem come rare,Positive

"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it.

But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.

Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it.

But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film.

"A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling.

It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time.

Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic.

The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.

Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.

An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.

Superior to pretty much everything else.

"The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.

The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: ""I'm not wearing hockey pads!"" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed.

The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname ""the Dark Knight"" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.

It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the﻿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.

The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes.

"The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.

The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much ""face time"" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.

Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right.",the dark knight wa probabl the best action film ive ever seen not onli is the design tone special fx sound and music all were excel but the script wa den complex and thorough the perform from the actor were all veri good particularli ledger who took the joker into a realm of sociopath that weve not seen in a batman charact befor thi may be ledger best perform from hi all too short career the onli issu i have is the extrem gross and gori of the twofac make upspeci fx i think it goe a bit too far to have littl bit of flesh dangl from hi visibl bone structur the onli thing i believ that wa better from the previou bat man seri but the director doesnt use too much face time on that charact so the look remain shock and not overdon certainli the dark knight will stand out for quit some time a the best comic book movi a it ha that a it root howev it may also stand a a masterpiec in it own right,Neutral
"The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him, but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film; the camera-work was excellent, the pace was gripping, the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid.

"I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.

The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.

Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.

I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.

If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now.

You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it.

"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.

*Runs*

The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.

Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?

We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?

Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.

Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.

Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven.",i have the flame suit on ive alreadi call my lawyer ive prepar fake passport and bought sever differ alias to run by i have also transfer my fund to a european account whi so seriou becaus here we go the dark knight is not the epic piec of godli art that everyon is hype it to be run the dark knight is a good piec of work a decent movi but doe not fall into nearperfect by ani mean despit the amaz perform write and action sequenc the heart and core of the comic book flavor is sever miss issu from batman begin is carri over and repeat here even though they arent a easi to spot thi is much better than begin but still fail to total era the memori of burton vision of batman resembl more the godfath and heat rather than a flick like iron man or spiderman it a total differ sort of movi involv superhero and supervillian gotham citi still doesnt truli look like gotham citi start the movi is a bank robberi unlik ani other set the tone of the movi instantli we see the joker heath ledger stir some earli troubl with the mob and crime lord we then see batman imit lurk about last but not least we see bruce wayn ex maggi gyllenha around the arm of anoth man harvey dent aaron eckhart then run amok throughout the minut of the dark knight are action sequenc plot twist sever surpris sever close call and a whole lot of crime drama good v evil is a battl that is horrif blur and human natur surround gotham citi is be test all the tension is overcom bruce wayn and batman and he begin question hi motiv and placement within the citi the write staff threw in plenti of deep and engag dialogu amongst all the action we see onscreen it a batman fan dream come true or is it we can start by credit heath ledger for a fine perform a the joker but if ledger deserv an oscar for hi role so should nicholson back in becaus believ there are mani similar in term of perform the joker here is cynic merciless and is bent on anarchi for no reasonbut so wa joker in if ledger win the oscar then jack himself should be accept it on hi behalf christian bale yet again fail a batman with hi frustrat raspi voic a bruce wayn he nail it but a batman he still need a bit of work when batman start monolog it hard not to cring the rest of the cast doe a good job most notabl gari oldman a lt gordon let also not forget morgan freedman michael cain aaron eckhart and maggi gyllenha the biggest strength of the batman univers lie within the balanc of batman and hi villain almost all of them have some sort of connect with our hero howev the treatment of villain yet again is disappoint a we see a few villain limit to mere cameo and the joker himself despit the trailer doe not get a much screen time a you may assum in the infam version we saw the joker rise from lowli punk crimin to a seriou threat to the entir citi in the dark knight unlik batman there is liter no explan a to whi he is the way he is there is no backstori reveal noth that could possibl explain hi physic appear and mental state sure he may craft some tale but whi believ a madman tale a he wield a knife to your lip dark knight best moment were not the action sequenc but the immens tension and suspens predat the payoff rare could you predict the outcom of some of the conflict and for the most part all the payoff were grand sometim lead to applaus the chase and actionpack moment themselv were also wellcraft and made great use of special effect yet with so mani problem fli at you at the same time it imposs to expect them all to be conclud and wrap up in the end nolan direct is stun from time to time but then he run out of steam toward the end of the third act when the movi is almost finish the end albeit unexpect wa a bit underwhelm and quit vagu especi consid the fact that the dark knight is minut long bottom line the neg is sprinkl about in thi review but dont let that fool you the dark knight is inde a great blockbust flick that will have you forget that there popcorn and soda by your side from the dazzl perform of the late heath ledger to the carefullyconstruct action sequenc that keep the pace flow there is plenti to prais about that be said it still not the best superhero movi of alltim batman is a comic book and the cast of thi new franchis must rememb thi you can dwell a much realism a youd like but the fact remain that thi isnt a realist franchis nor should it ever be treat a such gotham citi is still miss it gritti gothic dark architectur and style of burton film and need more emphasi on the villain that are in batman world the villain are the yang to the batman mytholog and batman himself is the yin you cant have too much of one and not enough of the other while it isnt batman and robin or fantast four both of them the dark knight still fall short of masterpiec qualiti simpli becaus of it exchang of comic book style for realist crime drama the dark knight is a great ride but not an epic one to qualiti heaven,Positive
"Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: ""If you only see one movie this summer, this is it"". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.

I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.

Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.

So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again.",rememb those say that magazin or critic would say one of the more popular one wa if you onli see one movi thi summer thi is it well until now i never understood that too well but now i realli realli do the dark knight is that movi a plain a i can say it the dark knight is by far the greatest most entertain movi releas all year period i had the privileg of see an advanc show for manag onli in imax about a week befor thi movi releas i wa ecstat that not onli wa i see thi much anticip movi a week earli but it wa my first imax experi if you have the option definit go with imax it wa unbeliev realli it felt like you were fli thru gotham citi about to fall into anoth scheme by the joker but enough about imax how about the movi well batman begin receiv exemplari rate from critic about an out of on imdb if i recal correctli a well sinc batman begin turn out so well and end with batman receiv word of the joker everi fan wa readi for thi movi asap just a short quick year later we final got the dark knight the main attract for thi show wa heath ledger part after hi sudden death some will be say that thi wa one of hi best perform and i can agre strongli the joker wa thrill yet comic heath brought out the dark villain even though he is well a joker all hi phrase and say made the movi what it wa but it still kept your mindset in fright mode veri hard to tackl look back on everi scene notic it wa hour and some odd minut i can not find a scene unnecessari few movi bare the except of be insan long but not at all bore and thi one fit that perfectli veri long veri detail but with patron pay that imax ticket price you want everi minut you can get i also could not find ani flaw realli with the movi except for the cast of maggi gyllenha anyon but kati holm wouldnt be good enough i mean maggi is pretti but not nearli a good look a kati holm sort of ruin her charact for me she is veri talent though absolut so after all wa said and done thi movi to me wa just about perfect out of christoph nolan absolut took batman to a new level and said forget the rest thi is top notch i want to watch it again,Neutral

"Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman).

This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.

A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨, ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part.

"The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot.

Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him.

My inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.

The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going.

As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be.",the dark knight is an intens power dramat and compel film but despit that im not sure i realli enjoy it a great deal i saw it on the huge imax screen in london which ha an abil to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film but at the same time variou aspect of the film meant that i felt alien from the charact and the plot who is batman and what do we realli know about him after have watch the whole film all hour of it im not sure i could say what are hi motiv doe he realli love rachel inde doe he have the capac to love at all again hint are given but the central charact is so poorli develop that it make it hard to realli care about what happen to him or those around him my inabl to empathis with the charact wasnt help by the ridicul number of subplot most of which are rush or incomplet and the relentless pace at which the film move from one to the other the film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storylin and develop the charact and theme within that the frenzi sequenc of larg unrel action setpiec whilst initi breathtak end up feel dull and predict what wa lack in between the explos wa anyth resembl meaning dialogu a few mumbl word from batman and some inan muse from the joker werent enough to keep the film go a such i left the film feel somewhat exhaust at the bleak joyless violent world i had wit and disappoint that thi muchhyp film just hadnt been a good a i wa hope it would be,Negative

"I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.

The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.

The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.

The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.

And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.

There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.

Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",i grew up on the anim seri love the first two batman film sort of like batman forev but disappoint in batman and robin i have yet to rewatch batman begin but i thoroughli enjoy thi film on rewatch have realli like it first time it is veri well made and grip with some great perform but person i would put casablanca wizard of oz amadeu and it a wonder life over thi the film doe suffer from be a littl too talki and the plot on occas can be hard to follow due to a lot go on nevertheless it is extrem good and not onli one of the better batman movi but also one of the better superhero movi visual and technic the film cannot be fault the cinematographi is superb and the spectacl of gotham citi is dazzl christoph nolan direct is taut and ensur that the action is explos the plot is a littl bloat with the joker bent on destroy organis crime for good and make batman cross between hero and vigilant and subplot about harvey dent and rachel daw and hong kong but there are some truli effect scene that are tightli structur and the screenplay in gener while a littl too talki in the first twenti minut is intellig and sophist the joker especi ha some veri sinist line that stay with you for a long while afterward the music by none other than maestro han zimmer who also compos music for the lion king gladiat and the pirat of the caribbean movi is outstand rous beauti haunt it is definit memor and doesnt becom forgett or gener like the music in the hurt locker for exampl and i have to say the sound engin here is phenomen particularli on veri high volum the explos sound veri authent a if they are come from outsid rather than from in the film and i have to mention the act a that wa terrif christian bale manag to be dark brood and charismat like batman should be though if i did have a complaint he doe speak in a veri hoar voic a if he got a sore throat and i somehow did not know what to make of it it wasnt irrit or anyth justodd anyway aaron eckhart is terrif a harvey denttwofac even if hi storylin wa a tad too rush and maggi gyllenha is veri sensit and care a rachel morgan freeman doe well in a smaller role a doe the excel gari oldman and michael cain is perfect a the loyal butler alfr there is no doubt in my mind that heath ledger gave the best perform of the film he wasnt just brilliant he wa phenomen unpredict insan extrem sinist and corrupt not to mention chillingli psychot i am torn on who i prefer over jack nicolson or heath ledger it is a veri close call i admit i am more familiar with nicolson portray and like hi mix of the scari and comic and even tragic joker but the joker here in the dark knight is truli sinist and even more of a threat to batman and in my opinion thi joker ha line that linger longer into the memori overal not absolut perfect but it is extrem good thank to primarili ledger perform and the dazzl visual spectacl bethani cox,Positive

"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight* is not just a superhero film; it is a gripping crime drama that transcends its genre to deliver a profound narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the human condition.

The film masterfully balances action with deep character development, showcasing Batman's struggle against not only external threats but also his internal demons. The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, particularly Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, which redefines the archetype of the villain. Ledger's Joker is chilling and chaotic, serving as the perfect foil to Batman's quest for justice.

Nolan's direction is taut, crafting a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The screenplay is sharp, blending intense action sequences with thought-provoking dialogue that raises significant ethical questions about the nature of heroism versus vigilantism.

The cinematography and score further elevate the film, with the haunting themes underscoring the emotional weight of the story. Each frame is meticulously crafted, contributing to an immersive experience that draws audiences into Gotham's dark underbelly.

Overall, *The Dark Knight* is a landmark in filmmaking that demands to be experienced. It is not only a thrilling ride filled with unforgettable moments but also a poignant exploration of the dichotomy between order and chaos, making it a film that resonates long after the credits roll.

"When I watched the dark knight for the first time, I was about 16 and I had mixed feelings towards it, I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer. Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after 'watching and having few knowledge' about some critically acclaimed films like ""the departed"", "" Inception "" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre .It was a game changer for my taste in films. It still tops the superhero genre even after 14 years of it's release. The only superhero/comic book film which comes close to this one is ""Logan"" in my opinion. So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of it's exploration towards many themes like human nature, dark reality of society, nature of lies, true and false characteristics and many more. Considering other parameters like cinematography, background score and screenplay, I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolan's films. So I end my review here, thanks for reading.

"""The Dark Knight"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic success that transcends the superhero genre, leaving a lasting mark on the world of film. Nolan masterfully weaves a complex and morally ambiguous take of chaos and order, exploring the thin line between heroism and villainy. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is legendary! He is a force of nature and added layers of depth to the character. Heath Ledger steals every scene with a magnetic presence that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. Christopher Nolan's vision, coupled with Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance makes it an instant modern classic.",the dark knight isnt just a movi it a cinemat success that transcend the superhero genr leav a last mark on the world of film nolan master weav a complex and moral ambigu take of chao and order explor the thin line between heroism and villaini heath ledger portray of the joker is legendari he is a forc of natur and ad layer of depth to the charact heath ledger steal everi scene with a magnet presenc that is both terrifi and mesmer christoph nolan vision coupl with heath ledger unforgett perform make it an instant modern classic,Neutral

"Quite simply ""Dark Knight"" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a ""proper"" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).

Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't ""just"" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of ""dark"" and of perception of ""society."" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.

Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these ""abilities"" about him which are soooo unrealistic.

So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.

The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!

I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!

Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.

It's cool It's original It's awesome

"Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.

""The Dark Knight"" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from ""Prison Break"", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but ""sometimes the truth is not good enough"".

"Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from cliché, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good.",write thi review at the tail end of open weekend the dark knight ha broken the record for open weekend and deservedli so thi film is a stepabov the standard summer blockbust howev the film also sit atop imdb top film of alltim list a rank that wont last nearli a long a it boxoffic rank line have been long to see thi film and mani of those who are vote on thi open weekend are diehard who wait in line and were readi to love thi film regardless of what it offer of cours the fact that thi film stand alon in it genr in term of write cinematographi art design and plot help boost it rate into the stratospher but when the non diehard begin to watch and vote well see thi film settl into it right place somewher in the top of all time it one of those few film that is entertain and access enough to plea the same peopl who went out in drove for spiderman while artist and smart enough to plea the more discern cinemat audienc truli disturb the charact were far from cliché a one would expect from the genr no charact is allgood or allbad ledger joker come close but earn a touch of sympathi none of the hero are flawless which is a sign of ani good film my singl complaint besid the variou hardtobeliev fall batman surviv is the rate thi film is fartoo disturb to garner a pg rate and deal with the ugliest side of human in a way that should probabl be accompani by a good convers that can add some perspect yet anoth reason whi thi film is so good,Negative
"And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like ""awesome"" and ""fantastic"" are thrown around way too much. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the plot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not in the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in almost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil.

The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace.

I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool.

I guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype.

"First of all, no I don't think this movie is bad. But I don't think it should be thought of as the gold standart for comic book movies. Because honestly, this movie doesn't feel like a comic book.

This is a very good action movie, that dresses it's main protagonist and antagonist as comic book characters. And here I think lies the problem.

This is a movie about a billionaire, dressed as a bat, who beats an anarchist clown. And Christopher Nolan tries to make this look serious. I'm sorry, it doesn't work. It just takes away the comic book feeling. And therefore it becomes a little boring. If Heath Ledger isn't on the screen I find myself hardly invested in what's happening.

To be honest, I never really liked this movie that much. Maybe because I first watched when I was 8 and it felt boring. But I watched it a few times in later years and I still remember only pieces of fractions of what's happening, outside of scenes that have the Joker. And to be fair, I probably wouldn't have remembered those pieces, if I didn't watch reviews out of boredom.

I went online to see if there is anybody who feels the same way and they all said the same thing: Heath Ledger single handedly saves this movie. And while his performance is spectacular, I can't think of him as a definitive Joker. He is good for this movie, but I'm not sure if I can see him fit in other Batman movies. And a personal bias of mine is that no one is ever going to top Mark Hamill. However, Ledger did his own thing and he did good. Unlike other main charachters in the movie, this one won people over. But it's still in a movie that plays everything too serious.

It feels like Nolan took the main charachters from a comic book and put them in this, just because otherwise it would have been just another action movie. It lacks a certain element. It lacks that comic book campiness, that even the most serious comic books have a pinch of in them. And therefore it fails to deliver as a comic book movie.

That's not to say that being serious is a bad change. Too many comic book are corny as hell and very often it gets annoying. But if you get too serious, you get boring. One should not be at the expense of the other. One must find a balance between the comic book campiness and the seriousness of the real world.

To quote a certain character: Why so serious?",first of all no i dont think thi movi is bad but i dont think it should be thought of a the gold standart for comic book movi becaus honestli thi movi doesnt feel like a comic book thi is a veri good action movi that dress it main protagonist and antagonist a comic book charact and here i think lie the problem thi is a movi about a billionair dress a a bat who beat an anarchist clown and christoph nolan tri to make thi look seriou im sorri it doesnt work it just take away the comic book feel and therefor it becom a littl bore if heath ledger isnt on the screen i find myself hardli invest in what happen to be honest i never realli like thi movi that much mayb becaus i first watch when i wa and it felt bore but i watch it a few time in later year and i still rememb onli piec of fraction of what happen outsid of scene that have the joker and to be fair i probabl wouldnt have rememb those piec if i didnt watch review out of boredom i went onlin to see if there is anybodi who feel the same way and they all said the same thing heath ledger singl handedli save thi movi and while hi perform is spectacular i cant think of him a a definit joker he is good for thi movi but im not sure if i can see him fit in other batman movi and a person bia of mine is that no one is ever go to top mark hamil howev ledger did hi own thing and he did good unlik other main characht in the movi thi one won peopl over but it still in a movi that play everyth too seriou it feel like nolan took the main characht from a comic book and put them in thi just becaus otherwis it would have been just anoth action movi it lack a certain element it lack that comic book campi that even the most seriou comic book have a pinch of in them and therefor it fail to deliv a a comic book movi that not to say that be seriou is a bad chang too mani comic book are corni a hell and veri often it get annoy but if you get too seriou you get bore one should not be at the expens of the other one must find a balanc between the comic book campi and the serious of the real world to quot a certain charact whi so seriou,Positive
"The Dark Knight actually got lucky. Movies over the last six years have been crap. Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.

It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.

The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining. Besides, movies over the last few years are all dark - even the light-hearted ones.

"for weeks leading up to the film movie insiders have been claiming that not only is it the best batman movie but that heath ledger deserves a Oscar nod for his work as the joker here is my short take on the film sorry its 4am and i just got home. the film overall is about as good as its every going to get as a action film and as a film on its own i really do think as of what i have seen so far it deserves at least a Oscar nom for best film the acting alround is just top shelf stuff. i will say this the film felt abit long but it needed to be. OK on to the cast, batman from watching the trailers and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i was worried that batman would be pushed into the back....this is not the case. the film overall doesn't follow one person it follows the story and i think thats what makes it such a good movie cause in the end the story is the important part. OK my one knock on the film heath ledgers joker was good but i didn't think it was Oscar good, i will say he holds his own with jack's joker....actually i think its better but i don't think is Oscar good. i liked the way they used him in the film he pops in does the damage and pops out and it really works best that way. now Aaron Eckhart's two face/dent makes tommy lee's a joke....but really aaron take on both dent and twoface were amazing the characters are taken to deep levels and it really gave the film a extra kick and props to the special effects guys it looked so real. bale i think carries the story well just like in begins while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movie over all turns out better for it, and its not like he doesn't have his moments ether. Gyllenhaal replaces homes and honestly i would have rather homes im not saying she did a bad job i just think with home's work on thank you for smoking she would have been a better choice if they could of had her. or wanted her? finally the supports of freeman caine and oldmen work just as well as they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of his screen time overall its easy to say this is by far the best of the batman movies. if i had to compare it to anything its like saying batman begins is like a star war iv and D.K is like EP:v both are good but this one just takes it that next level up",for week lead up to the film movi insid have been claim that not onli is it the best batman movi but that heath ledger deserv a oscar nod for hi work a the joker here is my short take on the film sorri it am and i just got home the film overal is about a good a it everi go to get a a action film and a a film on it own i realli do think a of what i have seen so far it deserv at least a oscar nom for best film the act alround is just top shelf stuff i will say thi the film felt abit long but it need to be ok on to the cast batman from watch the trailer and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i wa worri that batman would be push into the backthi is not the case the film overal doesnt follow one person it follow the stori and i think that what make it such a good movi caus in the end the stori is the import part ok my one knock on the film heath ledger joker wa good but i didnt think it wa oscar good i will say he hold hi own with jack jokeractu i think it better but i dont think is oscar good i like the way they use him in the film he pop in doe the damag and pop out and it realli work best that way now aaron eckhart two faced make tommi lee a jokebut realli aaron take on both dent and twofac were amaz the charact are taken to deep level and it realli gave the film a extra kick and prop to the special effect guy it look so real bale i think carri the stori well just like in begin while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movi over all turn out better for it and it not like he doesnt have hi moment ether gyllenha replac home and honestli i would have rather home im not say she did a bad job i just think with home work on thank you for smoke she would have been a better choic if they could of had her or want her final the support of freeman cain and oldmen work just a well a they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of hi screen time overal it easi to say thi is by far the best of the batman movi if i had to compar it to anyth it like say batman begin is like a star war iv and dk is like epv both are good but thi one just take it that next level up,Positive

"I know it sounds a bit too cliché when someone says this, but this is undoubtedly one of, if not the best superhero movie ever created! It excels in every field it touches - The visual effects are done perfectly, the acting is absolutely Oscar worthy, the multiple storylines that don't seem too complex in spite of being told at the same time and in spite of being just one movie of a trilogy it managed to win the hearts of everyone who saw it.

The story picks up very well from where Batman Begins ended. The post credit scene in that movie had shown Joker, and I can very well imagine how excited the audience must have been seeing it. The Batman and Joker duo is used to describe the social aspects of the society, and explain how people might behave if they are left unhinged. A hero who has his moral codes and a lot to lose, compared to a villain without any moral codes and nothing to lose yet have so much in common than what meets the normal eye. Ultimately both are seen as freaks who must be eliminated by the law.

Let's talk about the characters, starting from Christian Bale's Batman. His voice sounds horrible as Batman. Nowadays many people have begun criticising it, but they don't realise that if a real Batman has to change his voice, he only has two ways of doing it - either using a voice modulator like Ben Affleck's Batman does, or deal with trying to sound different, which isn't easy when he has to breathe heavily because of how hard he works. It's just fun to see the caped crusader doing something on the screen.

Next let's address Michael Caine's Alfred. He's a good representation of Alfred. Just by looking at him you get the feeling of both a butler and a guardian, something we know Alfred to be. And it can be seen very nicely when he dresses Bruce's wounds or talks to him about his crimefighting.

Then we have Aaron Eckhart's Two Face. Unlike the previous iteration that was seen in Batman Forever, this one seems a lot more serious. He went through a hefty character development, from the patriotic white Knight of Gotham, Harvey Dent, to the deranged psychopath who is ready to cross all limits if he wants to have his revenge.

Jim Gordon is also a much, much better iteration from what we had seen in the 1989 Batman. He actually looks like someone who is invested in his job and can contact Batman whenever he needs help. He is the kind of Gordon I imagine when I think of the animated movies. When someone mentions Jim Gordon, this is the one who comes to my mind.

And finally the elephant in the room, the show stealer - Heath Ledger's Joker. Just like Two Face, Joker here has also gone through a complete makeover from what he was portrayed as in the previous movie that came in 1989. It's kinda sad that Heath Ledger never got to know how famous he has become, but his legacy shall forever live in the DC universe.

The Dark Knight is one movie I often come back to just to remember these kinds of superhero movies are also possible. Every DC character should be given such movies where their character is shown to develop as time moves on.

"The film was very disappointing. Firstly Heath Ledger, wow didn't see that coming. He was terrific. From A knights tale to the dark knight...... not the same actor surely. The tongue flicks and glaring at the camera were very real indeed. I am going to compare this to the 1989 film because in recent times that is the best comparison we can make. The 89 film was entertaining, this wasn't. It was too dark, too dreary and left me feeling a bit depressed which just isn't the aim of comics. Christian Bale's voice as Batman was ridiculous, I didn't have any empathy with his character at all, didn't feel for him.... just nothing. Thought that I wouldn't want to live in Gotham as it was so dreary and felt that Commissioner Gordon was just too earnest. Chris Nolan gave us the excellent Memento and I think another good film in Insomnia. Though I appreciate the lack of CGI (very refreshing) and the last half an hour of the film, i fidgeted throughout and by the end felt I could have left early. Last year the Bourne Ultimatum rattled along and I came out of the cinema entertained. This was just depressing. Can't understand why this is considered to be the third best film of all time on IMDb...... astounding.",the film wa veri disappoint firstli heath ledger wow didnt see that come he wa terrif from a knight tale to the dark knight not the same actor sure the tongu flick and glare at the camera were veri real inde i am go to compar thi to the film becaus in recent time that is the best comparison we can make the film wa entertain thi wasnt it wa too dark too dreari and left me feel a bit depress which just isnt the aim of comic christian bale voic a batman wa ridicul i didnt have ani empathi with hi charact at all didnt feel for him just noth thought that i wouldnt want to live in gotham a it wa so dreari and felt that commission gordon wa just too earnest chri nolan gave u the excel memento and i think anoth good film in insomnia though i appreci the lack of cgi veri refresh and the last half an hour of the film i fidget throughout and by the end felt i could have left earli last year the bourn ultimatum rattl along and i came out of the cinema entertain thi wa just depress cant understand whi thi is consid to be the third best film of all time on imdb astound,Neutral

"After defeating the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have little time to return to normal life. The mafia is growing, and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger, in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals, no goals, no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also, a love triangle forms between Wayne, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).

There's little use in writing a review of ""The Dark Knight"" -- the critics loved it, fans love it, the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it, too, making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck, even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor).

I could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The ""Bat-Sonar"" was far-fetched, cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting, encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So, there was room for perfection (which is why this film, as great as it is, cannot receive a perfect score).

Concerns aside, the film was well done, as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige""). The action is intense, the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense, plot twists, unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fiancé fairly fast). And Heath Ledger, oh my.

The hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric, declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However, the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker, inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but Ledger brings his ""A"" game. If he is nominated, I accept it; and if he wins, that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year, in any genre.

As I said in the beginning, my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true, but judging by the sales of the picture, you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't, see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly, depending on the special features).

"Normally I would give this a 7.5 out of 10 but since I cant' I'll give it a seven. How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDb.com is amazing to me. It's mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one, it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have rated.

A couple things I noticed when I watch this movie, the movie goes on way too long. Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans. There are about 3 or 4 points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another 30 minutes. And while Heath Ledger's performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly, his Batman persona is a bit weak. The voice is annoying, and many times throughout the movie, he seemingly plays second fiddle.

I can't know Eckhart's casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesn't seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candy.

There are many things I can harp about but I'm not here to knock the movie. There are good points, cinematography great, Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts, mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too long.

BUT this movie doesn't even belong in mention to some of the greats and shame on many movie fans that had this movie rated higher than such classics as The Godfather.

"What is going on with all of these maximum ratings for a barely average film? According to IMDb, this is the best film of the decade so far. Not one sane person could argue that this is justified. Have the studios finally managed to get the masses to 'believe the hype'? I was a bit skeptical about this film, due to the hype, and especially because I wasn't impressed with Batman Begins, but I must admit, the heist in the first five minutes was excellent, and I thought my skepticism was unwarranted. But then Batman turned up and began speaking like a wrestler with throat cancer, and it continued to go down hill from there. What I didn't expect this film to be was tedious. But it was. It was far too long and bored my pants off me. There was no character development, the story was convoluted and over-complex and it was far too long. But my my main problem, and this goes against nearly every reviewer here, even those who weren't impressed, I thought Heath Ledger was absolutely awful! Who are these people calling for a posthumous Oscar? There is nothing I despise more than a 'look at me' performance. Ledger did all the tricks required to portray a 'crazy guy', including shifting his eyes up, down, left and right at every opportunity, and ingeniously, due to having his mouth cut as a child, he keeps licking around the inside of his mouth, which rather than being an impressive feat of method acting is actually as irritating as watching a fat man eat chips with his mouth open. His performance was utterly self-indulgent and it seems like all you sycophants fell for it. The only decent acting performance in this film is Eckhart. Caine and Morgan bore, and Bale, with his 'employ me for movie trailers' voice barely has one dimension. I would have rated this film higher if it hadn't taken itself so seriously, but as it stands it is a pretentious hyped-up and tedious movie.

"A perfectly made movie, with Heath Ledger at his best. Batman Begins started the trend of 'dark/serious' movies, and just when you thought a movie couldn't be better... The Dark Knight came out with an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger.

As much as you hate the Joker character in the movie, in the end you truly feel bad. Every scene he's in gets so intense with your eyes glued to the TV, it's really hard to get side tracked by thinking of something else!

"Whatever else it may be, ""The Dark Knight,"" Christopher Nolan's follow up to his ""Batman Begins,"" the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It's full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and don't let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can't possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.

The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and it's through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger's creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He's not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.

I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and it's this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.

The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.

So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it's still, after all, a Batman movie, and it's not the best film since ""Citizen Kane.""

"This is the first movie sense The Lord of the Rings movies that had mad, crazy, super hype and surpassed it. I thought it was getting hyped up for the wrong reasons (the tragedy). I had my doubts going into this film because everyone was talking about the Ledger. After seeing so many previews, after seeing the film and knowing what other films the actor was in, he NAILED the Joker.

I was happy that the film had more to offer than the preview had shown. It had some unexpected moments (which was good) and everyone one, and I do mean, everyone to include the bit players were wonderful in this movie. Nolan commanded and got some of the best work out of these people. Christian Bale just cemented that he is either better but no less than at the same level as Keaton's Batman and in the way, director Nolan film is better because it's more raw than Tim Burton's Batman. It doesn't seem like some faraway city. Kudos also goes to the City of Chicago for allowing Nolan to do whatever he wanted, so we have a lot less blue screen (cgi) effects and more realistic action sequences.

But the man of the hour, is Heath Ledger. Like in so many movies where the villain steals the movie, this is no exception. You can see and sense the insanity in Ledger's Joker. I mean Jack Nicholson played Jack in the first Batman, but who would have expected this demented performance out of Ledger. And it was a great performance without the over the top, maniacal campiness that actors tend to do when playing villains.

Now the only thing I wasn't crazy about was Batman's voice, it sounded a bit fake and it was hard to hear at times because it was so low. But that didn't take ANYTHING at all, away from the movie. This is a must to see on the big screen. I think its a must to see on the big screen twice and it's a must purchase on blu-ray when it's release. The movie runs about 2 hours and 45 minutes so be sure to take your bathroom break before the film start because you will not want to miss a minute.

Director/Writer Christopher Nolan has that special film makers touch. He screwed with out Heads with Memento. He dazzled us with The Presitge (another movie with Bale in it). He reinvigorated us with Batman Begins and now he stuns us with the well-crafted ""Dark Knight"". We all seen what could happen to a franchise in the hands of a lesser director (Batman Returns, Batman and Robin) and its nice to see something that takes your breath away. The Dark Knight will win lots of awards, but I think it already won the biggest, audience approval.

"I have enjoyed batman for a long time and despite my rabid fanaticism this movie took me to a whole new level. This is barely a superhero movie; it's utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all means. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the story, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledger's death which I feared might make the movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is a wonderful actress as Katie Holmes' replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was rather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the least, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for his performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own thespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined to have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You don't have to be a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless bubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid footing in this area.

"Frank Miller's The Dark Knight was one of the greatest comic series ever made. I was a young comic book collector when it first came out and I remember buying 5 copies a couple of days after its release and then watching it sell out in a few weeks. The price for the first edition sky-rocketed after just a couple of months to over $100, as second and third runs were printed.

What Miller did was nothing short of revolutionary. He depicted the Batman much the same way as the original 1930s Batman comics did - as a nearly maniacal, shadowy vigilante who sets forth to strike fear into the hearts of villains throughout Gotham. But he deepened the internal conflicts, the personal relationships, and the psychological aspects of the stories - especially the 2-3 episodes that dealt with the Joker. Miller's Joker was the flip-side of the Batman. An entirely sociopathic force for chaos and evil - and not entirely unlike the Batman at a deep structural level - driven by a similar kind of megalomania. The commonalities between the characters were just enough to shake Bruce Wayne to his core and to cause him to question everything he stood for.

Take note - With Iron Man and this film, Comic Book Films Have finally begun to realize their full potential.

Thankfully, The Dark Knight took aspects of Miller's version of the Joker and brought them to the screen faithfully - with adequate but not overbearing special effects, great acting talent, and a script worthy of Miller's work.

The Joker, devastatingly played by Heath Ledger, is not the quirky Cesar Romero prankster, nor the slightly demonic Jack Nicholson Commodore of Crime, but rather Frank Miller's ingenious, amoral, homicidal maniac. And he is anything but funny. The Joker reigns terror down on Gotham through a series of increasingly murderous experiments designed to test his nihilistic hypothesis concerning human nature. The Batman is being hunted by a righteous new district attorney for his vigilante approach to justice, and it is becoming increasingly clear that crime has stepped up its skill and intelligence to meet him at his own level. Bruce Wayne, plagued by personal difficulties and the deep conflicts of his dual life considers hanging up his cloak just when Gotham needs him most. But something about the Joker gets way under his skin.

The film even captures Miller's dark aesthetic of Gotham and the Batman consistently. Ledger is perfect, Bale is very good (though he was not given the depth afforded the Joker by the script, the story dictates that this will change in the next film), and the excellent, star-studded, supporting cast makes this blockbuster worth seeing by just about anybody.

For those who know the story and bring great expectations to this film - you will be rewarded with catharsis. For those who don't - prepare to see something you would never expect from a comic book based film - intense psychological drama and powerfully realized characterization.For those who are just looking for a fun and entertaining action film - you will get more than you bargained for in The Dark Knight, but may find it too lengthy and dark for your tastes.",frank miller the dark knight wa one of the greatest comic seri ever made i wa a young comic book collector when it first came out and i rememb buy copi a coupl of day after it releas and then watch it sell out in a few week the price for the first edit skyrocket after just a coupl of month to over a second and third run were print what miller did wa noth short of revolutionari he depict the batman much the same way a the origin s batman comic did a a nearli maniac shadowi vigilant who set forth to strike fear into the heart of villain throughout gotham but he deepen the intern conflict the person relationship and the psycholog aspect of the stori especi the episod that dealt with the joker miller joker wa the flipsid of the batman an entir sociopath forc for chao and evil and not entir unlik the batman at a deep structur level driven by a similar kind of megalomania the common between the charact were just enough to shake bruce wayn to hi core and to caus him to question everyth he stood for take note with iron man and thi film comic book film have final begun to realiz their full potenti thank the dark knight took aspect of miller version of the joker and brought them to the screen faith with adequ but not overbear special effect great act talent and a script worthi of miller work the joker devastatingli play by heath ledger is not the quirki cesar romero prankster nor the slightli demon jack nicholson commodor of crime but rather frank miller ingeni amor homicid maniac and he is anyth but funni the joker reign terror down on gotham through a seri of increasingli murder experi design to test hi nihilist hypothesi concern human natur the batman is be hunt by a righteou new district attorney for hi vigilant approach to justic and it is becom increasingli clear that crime ha step up it skill and intellig to meet him at hi own level bruce wayn plagu by person difficulti and the deep conflict of hi dual life consid hang up hi cloak just when gotham need him most but someth about the joker get way under hi skin the film even captur miller dark aesthet of gotham and the batman consist ledger is perfect bale is veri good though he wa not given the depth afford the joker by the script the stori dictat that thi will chang in the next film and the excel starstud support cast make thi blockbust worth see by just about anybodi for those who know the stori and bring great expect to thi film you will be reward with catharsi for those who dont prepar to see someth you would never expect from a comic book base film intens psycholog drama and power realiz characterizationfor those who are just look for a fun and entertain action film you will get more than you bargain for in the dark knight but may find it too lengthi and dark for your tast,Positive
"""The Dark Knight"" is, without a doubt, a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's second installment in the Batman trilogy takes everything that made ""Batman Begins"" great and cranks it up to an entirely new level.

First and foremost, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. His performance is haunting, mesmerizing, and unforgettable. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, and his ability to channel the character's madness is truly remarkable. It's a performance that stands as one of the greatest in cinematic history.

Christian Bale continues to excel as Batman, bringing depth and complexity to the role. The film's exploration of Batman's moral dilemmas and the blurred lines between heroism and vigilantism add a layer of sophistication to the character.

The supporting cast, including Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, all deliver outstanding performances that contribute to the film's overall brilliance.

What sets ""The Dark Knight"" apart from other superhero movies is its gritty and realistic portrayal of Gotham City. Nolan's direction and use of practical effects create a visually stunning and immersive world that feels tangible and lived-in.

The film's themes of chaos, morality, and the consequences of one's actions are thought-provoking and add depth to the narrative. The moral dilemmas faced by the characters make for a compelling and complex story that keeps you engaged from start to finish.

Additionally, Hans Zimmer's score is pulse-pounding and adds to the tension and excitement of the film's action sequences.

""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a superhero movie; it's a dark and gripping crime drama that explores the darkest corners of the human psyche. It's a film that challenges the audience to think and leaves a lasting impact.

"""Batman: The Dark Knight"" is an absolute masterpiece that transcends the superhero genre and stands as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time.

One of the most remarkable aspects of this film is Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. Ledger's portrayal of the iconic villain is nothing short of mesmerizing. He completely disappears into the character, delivering a chilling and unforgettable performance. Ledger's Joker is chaotic, unpredictable, and utterly compelling. His every scene is a masterclass in acting, and it's no surprise that he posthumously won an Academy Award for his role.

Christian Bale continues to excel as Bruce Wayne/Batman. His brooding intensity and unwavering commitment to the role make him one of the most compelling Batman interpretations to date. Bale's dedication to his craft is evident in every scene, and he brings a complex depth to the character.

Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent/Two-Face is another standout performance. His transformation from a principled district attorney to a vengeful and disfigured villain is handled with nuance and skill. It's a tragic arc that adds emotional weight to the film.

The film's screenplay, penned by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan, is a triumph of storytelling. It weaves together multiple plot threads, themes of morality, chaos, and the nature of heroism, and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish. The dialogue is sharp and thought-provoking, and the pacing is impeccable.",batman the dark knight is an absolut masterpiec that transcend the superhero genr and stand a one of the greatest cinemat achiev of all time one of the most remark aspect of thi film is heath ledger perform a the joker ledger portray of the icon villain is noth short of mesmer he complet disappear into the charact deliv a chill and unforgett perform ledger joker is chaotic unpredict and utterli compel hi everi scene is a masterclass in act and it no surpris that he posthum won an academi award for hi role christian bale continu to excel a bruce waynebatman hi brood intens and unwav commit to the role make him one of the most compel batman interpret to date bale dedic to hi craft is evid in everi scene and he bring a complex depth to the charact aaron eckhart portray of harvey denttwofac is anoth standout perform hi transform from a principl district attorney to a veng and disfigur villain is handl with nuanc and skill it a tragic arc that add emot weight to the film the film screenplay pen by christoph nolan and hi brother jonathan nolan is a triumph of storytel it weav togeth multipl plot thread theme of moral chao and the natur of heroism and keep the audienc on the edg of their seat from start to finish the dialogu is sharp and thoughtprovok and the pace is impecc,Neutral

"It's a very soft 9, but it's a 9/10 for me.

Directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer - these guys are in their primes here. Not that the same isn't true of some of the actors involved in this film, Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart.

It's hard for me to do a review on this film and certainly the character of the late Heath Ledger is one of the greatest villains in cinema history. He is played to perfection. Perfect would even be putting it mildly. Ledger is so great in this film that all the awards and recognition he has received from around the world are too little.

Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Gary Oldman are all super, but the one who shines brightest out of the entire cast with the exception of Ledger is Aaron Eckhart and his character, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Christopher Nolan's hidden ace. A perfect addition to the film's story.

The action scenes are OK, the sound is good, the film is generally very good technically and is far from the most successful in the genre, but the acting, the pacing and the story itself make The Dark Knight (2008) the giant that it is.

I recommend it along with the other two installments in the series, ""Batman Begins"" (2005), and the not-so-good ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012).

Final score: 9/10.",it a veri soft but it a for me direct by christoph nolan and written by christoph nolan jonathan nolan and david s goyer these guy are in their prime here not that the same isnt true of some of the actor involv in thi film heath ledger and aaron eckhart it hard for me to do a review on thi film and certainli the charact of the late heath ledger is one of the greatest villain in cinema histori he is play to perfect perfect would even be put it mildli ledger is so great in thi film that all the award and recognit he ha receiv from around the world are too littl christian bale michael cain maggi gyllenha and gari oldman are all super but the one who shine brightest out of the entir cast with the except of ledger is aaron eckhart and hi charact harvey denttwo face christoph nolan hidden ace a perfect addit to the film stori the action scene are ok the sound is good the film is gener veri good technic and is far from the most success in the genr but the act the pace and the stori itself make the dark knight the giant that it is i recommend it along with the other two instal in the seri batman begin and the notsogood the dark knight rise final score,Neutral
"I've been waiting for this film since I had seen Batman Begins in the cinema three/four years ago, but I was disappointed that I did not see anything new. It also didn't help that the plot in the film was muddled up. There were different subplots happening in between the film and by the last half I was totally lost; even my boyfriend has fallen asleep. I didn't like Maggie Gyllenhal's role as Rachael - she was bland as a blank of wood/black tea with no sugar, *really* boring as an actress!

As usual, Bale puts on a great performance and I have always enjoyed the films he has been in from the past (Machinist, The Prestige, Equiliberium, Batman Begins, American Psycho). However, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne, I felt I hadn't seen anything fresh from his performance or, if there was, this was overshadowed by the film (I am sure he will make up for this in Terminator 4). I like Christopher Nolan as well as a director, but I think this film was all about money and not about quality film-making. Compare this film to Memento and The Prestige - the Dark Knight is nowhere near as good as those films. In other words, from the 'success' this film has made, it would look as though Nolan has sold out which is a real shame.

I have idea no where thes hype about this film has come from, but I suspect it is because of the fact that people have been defining this film as one of Heath Ledger's ""finest performance"". Sure, his role as the Joker worked well on screen, but, even so, it is not worthy of winning a BAFTA/Oscar for his performance. People have generously given this film either a 9/10 simply because they have bought the fascination surrounding Ledger's performance/death along with the excessive violence and not judging on this film, realistically.

This film is worth no more than a 6, I am afraid - it should NOT be in IMDb's top 10.

"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" isn't merely a superhero movie; it's a magnum opus that redefines the genre. At its core is Heath Ledger's haunting portrayal of the Joker, a character study that delves into the darkest corners of human psyche. Ledger's performance is a revelation, crafting a Joker that is simultaneously terrifying and captivating.

Christian Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne is equally compelling, showcasing the internal struggle of a hero burdened by his sense of duty and the blurred line between justice and vengeance. The supporting cast, including Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman, deliver exceptional performances, adding layers of complexity to the narrative.

Nolan's direction is nothing short of genius, transforming Gotham City into a character itself-a gritty, sprawling urban landscape plagued by crime and corruption. The film's action sequences are meticulously choreographed, and the practical effects create a visceral sense of realism rarely seen in superhero films.

What sets ""The Dark Knight"" apart is its exploration of moral ambiguity and the choices that define us. The film raises profound questions about society, justice, and the nature of good and evil, challenging the audience's perceptions long after the credits roll. Hans Zimmer's score is the soul of the movie, underscoring the tension and emotion with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack.

In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that continues to captivate audiences worldwide. Its exceptional performances, intricate storytelling, and thought-provoking themes elevate it to the realm of timeless classics. A film that lingers in the mind and demands multiple viewings, ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a testament to the power of storytelling and remains an essential watch for anyone seeking profound cinematic experiences.",christoph nolan the dark knight isnt mere a superhero movi it a magnum opu that redefin the genr at it core is heath ledger haunt portray of the joker a charact studi that delv into the darkest corner of human psych ledger perform is a revel craft a joker that is simultan terrifi and captiv christian bale batmanbruc wayn is equal compel showcas the intern struggl of a hero burden by hi sen of duti and the blur line between justic and vengeanc the support cast includ aaron eckhart gari oldman and morgan freeman deliv except perform ad layer of complex to the narr nolan direct is noth short of geniu transform gotham citi into a charact itselfa gritti sprawl urban landscap plagu by crime and corrupt the film action sequenc are meticul choreograph and the practic effect creat a viscer sen of realism rare seen in superhero film what set the dark knight apart is it explor of moral ambigu and the choic that defin u the film rais profound question about societi justic and the natur of good and evil challeng the audienc percept long after the credit roll han zimmer score is the soul of the movi underscor the tension and emot with a hauntingli beauti soundtrack in conclus the dark knight is a cinemat triumph that continu to captiv audienc worldwid it except perform intric storytel and thoughtprovok theme elev it to the realm of timeless classic a film that linger in the mind and demand multipl view the dark knight stand a a testament to the power of storytel and remain an essenti watch for anyon seek profound cinemat experi,Neutral

"I would say best film related to superhero, for was last film with popular superhero I was able to watch without getting bored. Now day most of the stories are dreadful. The screenplay, penned by Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan, is a triumph of storytelling. The film's plot is intricate and multi-layered, exploring themes of chaos, morality, and the nature of heroism. It challenges both its characters and the audience to grapple with difficult questions, making it a cerebral experience within the superhero genre.

"Remember when the joker explains why he uses a knife instead of a gun? He prefers to savour the little details, read between the lines, appreciate the moment. As opposed to a violent, quick thrill of a gun. For me this film ended up being more like a machine gun than a knife.

Let's start with the excellent aspects of this film. Strong performances - Bale is fantastic, Michael Caine and Morgan freeman always produce excellent performances and this again does not disappoint, Heath ledger is impeccable. Music score is incredible by Hans Zimmer. Cannot imagine a better soundtrack is possible for this film. Epic use of image, immersing cinematography, the make up and costume department need a raise.

What's a mixed bag and what's poor . The plot - the plot is decent, but far from outstanding. It's about half an hour too long. There's certainly one chapter too many. In the last 45 mins we have hospital gate and ferry gate. You really need to choose only one there. The ferry scene paints to us what the joker is trying to prove - that when it comes down to it everyone will become selfish, save themselves before others no matter the cost. However I don't think they quite hit the nail on the head with it. The way it pans out, for me, is too unrealistic. Call it my lack of faith in human nature. I feel a more believable scenario of human heroism would've sent a stronger message. Hospital gate provides very little to the plot, except 20 mins of watching a headache. Philosophical themes and execution - Heath Ledger's acting is incredible so don't come at me, but the joker is too one dimensional. I get it, he likes chaos, but I want more depth. It may be good enough for the comics but not for a film to the caliber of this one. There's just a little too much spoon feeding dialogue. All this talk about chaos and human nature. Allow the audience to read between the lines, decifer the deeper meanings for themselves. Be a knife, not a gun. Pacing - I can't really fault the pacing until it comes to Harvey's transformation into two face. This part of the film is really poor. Even when I watched this film as a kid I was like come on. It's not even a character arc , he more or less wakes up a sadistic maniac, like Peter Parker just wakes up as spider man. Im not saying two face is a bad character, but a substantially more amount of time is necessary for us as the audience to realistically believe this transformation from hero to villain. And lastly, the film is just a bit too crash bang wallop. Just turn the volume down a little bit.

Now, I admit this review focuses more on the bad than the good. I can only say that's because everyone rates this film so highly that I think the weaknesses are more relevant. It's a great film and I understand the hype. But we have to admit there are major flaws to this film. I hate the way people really brand the word about 'overrated' , I don't like using it - it makes you sound as a sort of Scrooge. However , with an IMDB rating of 9/10 I think there might be a strong case for it right here.",rememb when the joker explain whi he use a knife instead of a gun he prefer to savour the littl detail read between the line appreci the moment a oppos to a violent quick thrill of a gun for me thi film end up be more like a machin gun than a knife let start with the excel aspect of thi film strong perform bale is fantast michael cain and morgan freeman alway produc excel perform and thi again doe not disappoint heath ledger is impecc music score is incred by han zimmer cannot imagin a better soundtrack is possibl for thi film epic use of imag immers cinematographi the make up and costum depart need a rais what a mix bag and what poor the plot the plot is decent but far from outstand it about half an hour too long there certainli one chapter too mani in the last min we have hospit gate and ferri gate you realli need to choos onli one there the ferri scene paint to u what the joker is tri to prove that when it come down to it everyon will becom selfish save themselv befor other no matter the cost howev i dont think they quit hit the nail on the head with it the way it pan out for me is too unrealist call it my lack of faith in human natur i feel a more believ scenario of human heroism wouldv sent a stronger messag hospit gate provid veri littl to the plot except min of watch a headach philosoph theme and execut heath ledger act is incred so dont come at me but the joker is too one dimension i get it he like chao but i want more depth it may be good enough for the comic but not for a film to the calib of thi one there just a littl too much spoon feed dialogu all thi talk about chao and human natur allow the audienc to read between the line decif the deeper mean for themselv be a knife not a gun pace i cant realli fault the pace until it come to harvey transform into two face thi part of the film is realli poor even when i watch thi film a a kid i wa like come on it not even a charact arc he more or less wake up a sadist maniac like peter parker just wake up a spider man im not say two face is a bad charact but a substanti more amount of time is necessari for u a the audienc to realist believ thi transform from hero to villain and lastli the film is just a bit too crash bang wallop just turn the volum down a littl bit now i admit thi review focus more on the bad than the good i can onli say that becaus everyon rate thi film so highli that i think the weak are more relev it a great film and i understand the hype but we have to admit there are major flaw to thi film i hate the way peopl realli brand the word about overr i dont like use it it make you sound a a sort of scroog howev with an imdb rate of i think there might be a strong case for it right here,Positive
"The trick to these comic book superhero movies is not to take the source material too seriously. That's what made the original Batman from the 1980's, with Jack Nickolson as the Joker, work so well; everything about that movie, including all the main characters, was over the top, and rightfully so. We are, after all, talking about a man who goes out and fights crime while dressed up as a bat. How seriously, really, are we supposed to take such a notion? But this movie (among its various other flaws) takes itself WAY too seriously. It's supposed to be some deep, even epic, tale of, well, something. But, hey, if I want that, I could read Homer. Or Shakespeare. Or watch ""The Godfather"". Stories that truly are epic, in no small part because they feature real human characters, not ones that came out of a cartoon book.

That said, I can only review so much of this movie because, quite honestly, I don't remember all that much from it. Nothing about it truly stood out in my mind, other than that the general theme seemed to be to inflict upon the audience several scenes of considerable cruelty and sadism. And, unlike in other movies where these qualities played a significant role (Silence of the Lambs, Apocalypse Now), here these elements seem to exist solely for shock value, not because they actually add anything to our deeper understanding of the story.

Which brings us to the character of the Joker. Let me be blunt - Nickolson's Joker was at least ten times better than this one. Both are completely unbelievable, but Jack's Joker was at least interesting, even fun. He was a pleasure to watch in much the same way that a good James Bond villain is. But there is nothing pleasurable at all about Heath Ledger's Joker. First off, he is so psychotic that he couldn't function anywhere outside of an insane asylum; he kills off his own henchmen, burns their stolen money before their very eyes, yet this psycho somehow enlists a small army of loyal followers without giving them any reason to be loyal at all, and yet, despite being a complete walking mental meltdown, he manages to put in motion any number of very detailed terrorist plots that would require the exact opposite mindset, namely, one of cold and calculating rationality. In short, as a movie villain, he simply fails. Not only is he not credible at all, his sole contribution to the story is to add the aforementioned cruelty and sadism, making this not only a stupid and unbelievable movie, but a thoroughly depressing one as well. I mean, seriously. If you want to see movie characters who have a dark, twisted, and sadistic streak and yet come off as credible on the screen, one need look no further than such persons as Tommy from ""Goodfellas"" or Luca Brasi from ""The Godfather"". But the Joker from this film is just a void. Encountering his character was like stepping on a dog turd. The experience is wholly unpleasant and disgusting, but thankfully you forget about it pretty soon.

"Oddly enough, I don't go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that it'll be over-hyped and bloated; that's just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy.

As I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledger's unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isn't just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeare's finest plays.

Let's first get to what I didn't like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movie's predecessor, Batman Begins. See, I've always thought the complex Batman character should be someone who's consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know he's got this secret identity thing going, and he doesn't tell people everything, and that's nice. Endearing, even. But Bale's inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that there's more than meets the eye. Bale's Batman doesn't feel like he's consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim.

Moving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because she's smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we don't see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday they'll get it right.

And then there's the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and it's like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart can't quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy who's better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dent's a noble crusader, the district attorney who's going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll who's there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, you'd think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesn't seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here.

The movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! It's not over yet! What will happen next? But surely there's a way to do this without producing a film that's two and a half hours long. If you're going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City.

But here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruce's conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because it's supposed to be gloomy ol' Gotham.

So for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. It's not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we don't even get clever plotting that we might expect from what's purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. There's much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - that's forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger.",oddli enough i dont go into a theater befor watch a blockbust movi with the

"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that transcends the superhero genre, delivering a dark and immersive experience that is nothing short of spectacular. From its gripping storyline to its impeccable cast, every element of this film contributes to its status as a modern masterpiece.

Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is iconic, a chilling and mesmerizing performance that stands as one of the greatest in cinematic history. Ledger's ability to embody the chaotic nature of the character brings an unparalleled depth to the film, making every scene with the Joker an edge-of-your-seat experience.

Christian Bale reprises his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, and his performance is equally compelling. Bale's nuanced portrayal captures the internal struggles of a hero burdened by the weight of his mission, adding a layer of humanity to the iconic figure.

Nolan's direction is nothing short of brilliant, crafting a Gotham City that feels both gritty and grandiose. The film's pacing is relentless, keeping audiences engaged from start to finish. The use of practical effects and minimal CGI enhances the film's realism, creating a Gotham that feels tangible and immersive.

The screenplay, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, weaves a complex narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the nature of heroism. The dialogue is sharp and thought-provoking, elevating the film beyond typical superhero fare.

Hans Zimmer's score is the heartbeat of ""The Dark Knight,"" intensifying every moment and contributing to the film's emotional depth. The iconic theme associated with the Joker adds an extra layer of unease, perfectly complementing Ledger's phenomenal performance.

In summary, ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic tour de force, a film that transcends its genre and stands as a testament to the artistic potential of superhero storytelling. Christopher Nolan's vision, combined with outstanding performances and technical prowess, has created a film that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the greatest of its time.",christoph nolan the dark knight is a cinemat triumph that transcend the superhero genr deliv a dark and immers experi that is noth short of spectacular from it grip storylin to it impecc cast everi element of thi film contribut to it statu a a modern masterpiec heath ledger portray of the joker is icon a chill and mesmer perform that stand a one of the greatest in cinemat histori ledger abil to embodi the chaotic natur of the charact bring an unparallel depth to the film make everi scene with the joker an edgeofyourseat experi christian bale repris hi role a batmanbruc wayn and hi perform is equal compel bale nuanc portray captur the intern struggl of a hero burden by the weight of hi mission ad a layer of human to the icon figur nolan direct is noth short of brilliant craft a gotham citi that feel both gritti and grandios the film pace is relentless keep audienc engag from start to finish the use of practic effect and minim cgi enhanc the film realism creat a gotham that feel tangibl and immers the screenplay cowritten by nolan and hi brother jonathan weav a complex narr that explor theme of moral chao and the natur of heroism the dialogu is sharp and thoughtprovok elev the film beyond typic superhero fare han zimmer score is the heartbeat of the dark knight intensifi everi moment and contribut to the film emot depth the icon theme associ with the joker add an extra layer of uneas perfectli complement ledger phenomen perform in summari the dark knight is a cinemat tour de forc a film that transcend it genr and stand a a testament to the artist potenti of superhero storytel christoph nolan vision combin with outstand perform and technic prowess ha creat a film that will undoubtedli be rememb a one of the greatest of it time,Positive

"The world of superheroes has always been captivated by larger-than-life characters, but none have left as indelible a mark on pop culture as the iconic Dark Knight. Batman, a character beloved for his complex persona and thrilling adventures, has been brought to life in various mediums, but with the latest film, it's clear that the Caped Crusader has found a new home on the big screen. The 2023 Batman film, directed by visionary filmmaker David Fincher, is a visual masterpiece that brings this iconic character to life in ways that have never been seen before.

For someone like me, whose introduction to Batman came through animated series and comics, this film was a thrilling revelation. I was initially drawn to the character through the brilliant Batman: The Animated Series and various comic books. However, seeing Batman in a live-action setting, enhanced by state-of-the-art visual effects (VFX), was a game-changer. The film takes the character's appeal and magnifies it, creating a cinematic experience that is as thrilling as it is visually stunning.

The supporting cast is equally impressive. Selina Kyle, portrayed by a charismatic actress, embodies the complex and enigmatic Catwoman. Her chemistry with Batman is palpable, and their dynamic adds depth to the story. The film also introduces a formidable antagonist in the form of the Riddler, played by an actor who brings a chilling and intellectual malevolence to the character. The way the Riddler's elaborate puzzles and clues are woven into the narrative keeps the audience engaged in a thrilling and suspenseful mystery. Whether you're a long-time Batman aficionado or a newcomer to the world of Gotham City, this film is a must-see. Batman's legend has never shone brighter on the silver screen.",the world of superhero ha alway been captiv by largerthanlif charact but none have left a indel a mark on pop cultur a the icon dark knight batman a charact belov for hi complex persona and thrill adventur ha been brought to life in variou medium but with the latest film it clear that the cape crusad ha found a new home on the big screen the batman film direct by visionari filmmak david fincher is a visual masterpiec that bring thi icon charact to life in way that have never been seen befor for someon like me whose introduct to batman came through anim seri and comic thi film wa a thrill revel i wa initi drawn to the charact through the brilliant batman the anim seri and variou comic book howev see batman in a liveact set enhanc by stateoftheart visual effect vfx wa a gamechang the film take the charact appeal and magnifi it creat a cinemat experi that is a thrill a it is visual stun the support cast is equal impress selina kyle portray by a charismat actress embodi the complex and enigmat catwoman her chemistri with batman is palpabl and their dynam add depth to the stori the film also introduc a formid antagonist in the form of the riddler play by an actor who bring a chill and intellectu malevol to the charact the way the riddler elabor puzzl and clue are woven into the narr keep the audienc engag in a thrill and suspens mysteri whether your a longtim batman aficionado or a newcom to the world of gotham citi thi film is a mustse batman legend ha never shone brighter on the silver screen,Positive

"After reading quite a few reviews from the states i was very curious about this movie. As a kid i loved to read superhero comic books, spiderman and batman were my favourites. Loving the spiderman movies and also liking the first new Batman movie by Nolan and wanting to see the last performance by Heath Ledger i couldn't wait to see this movie.

Man was i disappointed.

Don't get me wrong, i liked the movie, i had fun with it and the performance bij Heath Ledger is something i will never forget. I was sceptical about him because people tend to exaggerate performances of popular dead actors but i must honestly admit, he blew me away. He also blew every actor away he shared screen time with, i liked gary oldman best together with him in a scene. I am still wowed by Hedgers performance, and i must admit i really feel frustrated that he is gone, this performance MUST get an Oscar.

Caine was very good, Bale was OK although i don't like him as batman, he is a good Bruce Wayne but not a good batman and i really enjoyed Aaron Eckart as Harvey Dent.

But i thought the movie also had quite a few flaws.

Without giving away too much i really though most of the combat action scenes were not easily watchable because they were to fast to follow, I really didn't like the way they went with two face, and the ending sequence with the bat and the joker to me was a let down. Also i don't like the way Nolan tells the story but i must admit, thats a personal opinion.

There were 2 surprising moments that i really loved, one containing a pencil which got me laughing very hard and the other the choice sequence which ended in a way i didn't see coming but loved it.

All in all, an OK superhero movie, 7 stars but 9? come on people, that's crazy.

It's unbelievable that movies like the matrix 1 , gladiator, as good as it gets, l.a. confidential, eternal sunshine and the spotless mind don't rank as high as this movie, i cant understand it although i respect it.

", yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions.

"Heath ledgers character, the joker is phenomenal. One of the best acting performances ever. The dark night is a great movie, but not the best. Not in the top 25. It's Avery good movie with a thrilling story but it is a bit overrated. This movie never really gets old. And the story of heath ledger and the joker role pushing his mental state further.

"The Dark Knight is an extraordinary mish-mash lacking logic and cohesion.

Technically, the film is well made. That is, it looks and feels like a blockbuster, though a solid score is sorely lacking.

On the plus side, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman add gravitas to an otherwise ordinary ensemble.

And sadly, a fine actor will be remembered, not for the likes of moving and sensitive performances seen in Brokeback Mountain and Candy, but rather an excellent make-up job, an over-active tongue and a silly voice. As farewell performances rate, Heath Ledger's Joker sits alongside Peter Sellers' Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu.

"This film is a magnificent piece of work which will likely not be rivaled for years to come. The most well known antagonist in the Batman comics is undoubtedly the Joker, and Heath Ledger portrays the necessary insanity and sadism perfectly. Christian Bale as Batman leaves nothing more to be desired, and every shot of Gotham city fills you with the mystery and dread that you would expect from a city littered with crime. You can feel the sense that the city is not in a good state directly from the movie's beginning, and the Dark Knight of Gotham has to rise to the challenge. The entire plot line will pull you deeper into the movie. Every time that you think that a little scene is unimportant, there is sudden relevance to the bigger picture to Gotham.

"Some of the very first words Christian Bale utters as the eponymous role of 'soon-to-be-Batman' Bruce Wayne, in the preceding Batman film to this entitled Batman Begins, are to a thug in a remote prison located in the Far East: ""you're not The Devil, you're practise"" he hisses. The feeling's that 2008's The Dark Knight is where the practise ends and the fight with The Devil begins. This is my second crack at writing something up about the film, and while what I said initially was a little unfocused and targeted the wrong areas; I stand by the initial grade I gave it and similarly retained that similar sense of feeling underwhelmed when it finished. Even if it is deemed that The Dark Knight is one of the better comic book adaptations ever made, this is not saying a terrible lot given the bulk of entries in said film canon.

That old problem of dealing with the war genre and doing one's very best to document war as a horrid, gut-wrenching thing whilst maintaining sequences of war that cannot help but carry a sense of spectacle anyway, rears its head here. The Dark Knight documents a war on terrorism and sees Christohper Nolan attempt to echo a greater sense of things in the real world as he unleashes a character known as The Joker (Ledger) amongst the inhabitants of Gotham City, The results of his terrorist 'acts' in bringing down entire buildings allow Nolan to shoot the wreckage of said act with firefighters in the foreground and smoking rubble in the back, clearly calling on immediate 'post' imagery of the 9/11 New York attacks. Incidentally, and as one source which escapes me suggested, Joker's videos of captives held and forced to talk into video cameras evoke the actions of overseas terrorist cells, and their own methods of getting the message across to The West; while most of his scenes in which he is seen pottering around an area trying to intimidate carry an odd, distorted and erratic hand held aesthetic suggesting danger, distortion and chaos. Later on, semiology linked to fire fighting will be used again in the briefest of fashions, when a certain character, who's under threat from The Joker, is being transported in a police van: a burning fire truck is used as a blockade, and Nolan cleverly instills a further sense of victimised anguish into the audience.

In addition to biting all of this off, Nolan does his best to render the film a gangster film-come-neo noir whilst operating under this banner of a low MPAA/BBFC rating as the film additionally attempts to draw on parallels between The Joker, Batman and a third piece to the triangle in district attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart). Indeed the film opens with an audacious robbery of mob money, as perpetrated by The Joker; his menace established by the fact his cohorts contribute varying perspectives of the man whilst we perceive him to still be off screen. The robbery itself carries a clever twist in that each member kills the other when his job is done, a small but highly affecting twinge to proceedings as dreamt up by The Joker thus cementing his personality and mindset in being able to cook up something such as this. As a fighter of crime, Dent lacks the physical strength Batman does but talks a good talk and is able to place a number of criminals in jail after some hard work as he adopts his own stance on the front line of crime. Shortly afterwards, it is Gary Oldman's police lieutenant Jim Gordon whom refers to him as Gotham's ""white knight"", suggesting the man shares a similar overview to Batman's ""dark"" but is just different in technique and characteristics.

Joker's parallel with Batman sees the film establish such a relationship by way of two accompanying scenes, one seeing The Joker and a handful of representatives from Gotham's gangs occupy a kitchen and talk of certain issues. Annoyingly, the representatives are your more generic bling-wielding African-Americans; well dressed Italian American mobsters and gruff, greasy haired eastern European criminals. Cut to Gordon, Batman and Dent beside the bat signal doing the exact same thing but whose discussions and ideologies obviously differ; a later pairing of sequences seeing The Joker deal with a black criminal, whom he feels ought to be working with him, in a blunt fashion just as Batman does the same to a Chinese businessman named Lau whom he feels similarly towards in this sense, thus suggesting a more intrinsic link between the two. As is the rule of thumb in films such as Heat or American Gangster, Joker and Batman share a sequence in which they sit opposite one another at a table; on this occasion, and as other sources have stated, right before contemporary issues on the treatment of terrorists once in custody have arisen.

Where the film falls apart is its want to cater to an audience with superhero sub-genre frills, an interesting parallel drawn up between Dent as a frothing at the mouth monster named Two-Face seeking revenge and Batman, as two people differently channelling anger born out of injustices towards people they love plays out, but getting bogged down with out of sorts fight scenes and ridiculous sequences in 'sonar vision' which does nothing but juvenalise adult content. Most of the second unit stuff is nowhere near as interesting as the talk and studious observations on identity and personality; a chase through a tunnel which spills onto the streets involving a police van; a large truck and a bat-bike rather underwhelming. The film relies on rife corruption all too often to further its narrative so as to send it down another avenue of twists and turns, ultimately a story which is not as interesting as all the aforementioned character studies and power play going on as binary opposites supposedly attract and everybody's linked to each other. Ultimately only fleetingly interesting, and all too often feels bogged down.",some of the veri first word christian bale utter a the eponym role of soontobebatman bruce wayn in the preced batman film

"Iconic! ""The Dark Knight,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic tour de force that redefines the superhero genre. Released in 2008, this film stands as a testament to the transformative power of storytelling and the impact of exceptional performances. At its core, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. Ledger's posthumous Academy Award-winning performance elevates the character beyond a mere antagonist, making the Joker a symbol of chaotic brilliance and anarchy.

Christian Bale, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, brings a brooding intensity that complements the film's exploration of duality and morality. Nolan's direction is masterful, creating a gritty and realistic Gotham City that becomes a character in itself. The cinematography, coupled with Hans Zimmer's haunting score, adds layers of tension and depth to the narrative.

""The Dark Knight"" transcends the typical superhero narrative, evolving into a crime thriller that delves into the complexities of heroism. The film's social commentary on the thin line between order and chaos resonates throughout, challenging audiences intellectually and emotionally. As the capstone of Nolan's Batman trilogy, ""The Dark Knight"" sets a high standard with its thought-provoking narrative, exceptional performances, and cinematic brilliance.

This film isn't just a comic book adaptation; it's a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll. Its impact on the superhero genre is undeniable, and its legacy continues to influence filmmakers, setting a standard that few have matched. ""The Dark Knight"" remains a beacon of excellence, reminding us that a superhero film can be both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern filmmaking.",icon the dark knight direct by christoph nolan is a cinemat tour de forc that redefin the superhero genr releas in thi film stand a a testament to the transform power of storytel and the impact of except perform at it core heath ledger portray of the joker is noth short of legendari ledger posthum academi awardwin perform elev the charact beyond a mere antagonist make the joker a symbol of chaotic brillianc and anarchi christian bale repris hi role a bruce waynebatman bring a brood intens that complement the film explor of dualiti and moral nolan direct is master creat a gritti and realist gotham citi that becom a charact in itself the cinematographi coupl with han zimmer haunt score add layer of tension and depth to the narr the dark knight transcend the typic superhero narr evolv into a crime thriller that delv into the complex of heroism the film social commentari on the thin line between order and chao reson throughout challeng audienc intellectu and emot a the capston of nolan batman trilog the dark knight set a high standard with it thoughtprovok narr except perform and cinemat brillianc thi film isnt just a comic book adapt it a cinemat experi that linger long after the credit roll it impact on the superhero genr is undeni and it legaci continu to influenc filmmak set a standard that few have match the dark knight remain a beacon of excel remind u that a superhero film can be both entertain and intellectu stimul leav an indel mark on the landscap of modern filmmak,Neutral

"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight,"" released in 2008, is more than just a superhero film; it's a profound exploration of chaos, morality, and heroism, wrapped in a gripping, action-packed narrative. This film redefined the genre, setting a high bar for subsequent superhero movies and cementing its place as a cinematic classic.

At the heart of ""The Dark Knight"" is a complex narrative that delves into the dichotomy of good and evil, embodied by Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). The storyline picks up from where ""Batman Begins"" left off, with Gotham City experiencing a relative calm thanks to Batman's vigilantism. However, this peace is shattered by the emergence of the Joker, a criminal mastermind whose anarchic philosophy and unpredictable nature push Batman to his ethical and physical limits.

Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of iconic. His performance is chillingly brilliant, bringing an unsettling yet captivating energy to the screen. Ledger's Joker is not just a villain; he is chaos personified, with no discernible motive other than to create havoc. His eerie laughter, erratic behavior, and philosophical musings about the nature of mankind elevate the character beyond a mere comic book antagonist to a symbol of anarchy. Ledger's untimely death shortly after filming added a poignant layer to his performance, which was rightfully awarded a posthumous Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.

Christian Bale's Batman is equally compelling, presenting a hero burdened by the weight of his dual identity. Bale masterfully portrays the conflict within Bruce Wayne as he grapples with his sense of duty to Gotham and his personal desire for a normal life. This internal struggle is intensified by his relationships with his loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine), his confidante Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), and his love interest, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal).

Nolan's direction is meticulous, blending high-octane action sequences with deep, philosophical inquiries. The film's opening bank heist scene is a masterclass in tension and sets the tone for the ensuing chaos. The intricate plot, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is layered with themes of sacrifice, justice, and the moral ambiguities of vigilantism. The narrative's complexity is matched by Wally Pfister's cinematography, which captures the gritty realism of Gotham City, and Hans Zimmer's haunting score, which heightens the film's intense atmosphere.

One of the film's central themes is the ethical and psychological battle between Batman and the Joker. The Joker's taunting assertion that Batman's moral code is a weakness is a recurring motif, challenging the very foundation of Batman's crusade. This philosophical duel reaches its zenith in the iconic interrogation scene, where the Joker goads Batman with unsettling truths about the nature of order and chaos.

""The Dark Knight"" also explores the impact of heroism and vigilantism on society. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Gotham's ""White Knight,"" represents hope and lawful justice, but his tragic descent into Two-Face illustrates the corrupting influence of Gotham's darkness. Dent's transformation serves as a stark reminder of the thin line between heroism and villainy, a line that Batman himself must constantly navigate.

Technically, the film is a marvel. The practical effects, including the unforgettable truck flip and the jaw-dropping hospital explosion, are executed with precision, eschewing CGI in favor of real-world stunts that lend authenticity to the spectacle. Lee Smith's editing ensures a brisk pace, seamlessly weaving multiple storylines without losing narrative coherence.

""The Dark Knight"" is not merely a superhero film; it is a profound meditation on the nature of good and evil, the fragility of order, and the sacrifices required for true heroism.

"This Batman installment isn't a bad one it's just been completely overrated since the passing of Heath Ledger. Secondly there was way too much material to be packed into the three hours alloted. If anyone knows anything about the back story of Harvey Dent/Two Face they are just left feeling empty and the character itself unjustified. I understand Nolan was trying to do something different with the Joker, but why disrespect Two Face? Also, there was really no Batman/Bruce Wayne complex which I enjoy and feel is important to every Batman film. Overall a good action film, but will not be adding to my Batman movie collection. Hopefully Nolan brings back Two Face in the next film and gives him a face.",thi batman instal isnt a bad one it just been complet overr sinc the pas of heath ledger secondli there wa way too much materi to be pack into the three hour allot if anyon know anyth about the back stori of harvey denttwo face they are just left feel empti and the charact itself unjustifi i understand nolan wa tri to do someth differ with the joker but whi disrespect two face also there wa realli no batmanbruc wayn complex which i enjoy and feel is import to everi batman film overal a good action film but will not be ad to my batman movi collect hope nolan bring back two face in the next film and give him a face,Neutral

"Title: ""A Cinematic Triumph: 'The Dark Knight' Reimagines Batman Like Never Before""

Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a masterpiece of modern cinema. Released in 2008, this film marked a pivotal moment in the superhero genre, forever changing the way audiences perceive not only Batman but also the entire genre itself. With a mesmerizing blend of storytelling, unforgettable performances, and groundbreaking visuals, ""The Dark Knight"" remains an iconic achievement.

At its core, ""The Dark Knight"" is a crime drama wrapped in the guise of a superhero movie. Unlike its predecessors, this installment presents Batman as a complex vigilante facing moral dilemmas rather than a mere caped crusader fighting crime. Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman and delivers a mesmerizing performance. His portrayal is a perfect blend of brooding intensity and vulnerability, allowing the audience to empathize with the inner turmoil of the character.

However, the true standout performance in ""The Dark Knight"" is Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker. Ledger's take on the iconic Batman villain is nothing short of extraordinary. His Joker is an agent of chaos, a sadistic and unpredictable force who challenges Batman both physically and philosophically. Ledger's commitment to the role is palpable, and he disappears into the character, leaving the audience in awe of his magnetic and chilling performance. It's no exaggeration to say that Ledger's Joker is one of the most iconic and memorable villains in cinematic history.

The supporting cast also shines in their respective roles. Gary Oldman's Commissioner Gordon is the moral compass of Gotham City, and Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent is a charismatic district attorney whose transformation into Two-Face is both tragic and compelling. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine bring depth and wisdom to their characters, providing the emotional grounding needed amidst the chaos.

Nolan's direction is nothing short of visionary. He creates a dark and gritty Gotham City that feels both hauntingly realistic and heightened in its cinematic grandeur. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and shot, immersing the audience in the heart-pounding intensity of Batman's world. Nolan's use of practical effects and minimal CGI adds a tangible weight to the film's action, making every punch and explosion feel real.

One of the most remarkable aspects of ""The Dark Knight"" is its exploration of complex moral themes. The film delves into questions of justice, morality, and the nature of heroism. Batman's ethical code is put to the test as he faces the Joker's nihilistic philosophy. The film challenges the audience to consider the cost of heroism and the blurred line between hero and villain.

In addition to its thematic depth, ""The Dark Knight"" is a masterclass in storytelling. The script, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is a taut and intelligent narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The film's pacing is impeccable, with each scene building upon the last, leading to a breathtaking climax that will leave you breathless.

Hans Zimmer's score is another element that elevates ""The Dark Knight"" to a cinematic tour de force. The hauntingly beautiful music underscores the emotional beats of the film, heightening the tension and drama. Zimmer's use of recurring motifs, such as the Joker's theme, adds a layer of psychological depth to the characters.

It's worth noting that ""The Dark Knight"" is not a typical superhero film. It transcends the genre by delivering a mature and thought-provoking narrative that appeals to a broad audience. While it contains thrilling action sequences and epic battles, it also explores the human side of its characters, making it a character-driven drama that just happens to involve superheroes.

In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that redefined the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance as the Joker, and the film's exploration of complex moral themes all contribute to its status as a modern classic. It's a film that continues to resonate with audiences and stands as a testament to the power of storytelling in cinema.

"""According to what I believe, what doesn't kill a person makes him strange.""

Normally, I had no intention of watching this legend tonight. When I came across it on a TV channel, I got stuck on it. Then, when I realized how bad the dubbing was and that the movie would not be watched in this way, I turned on my 1080p format to watch the movie from the beginning without ads and in its original language.

This movie is at the beginning of very special movies for me. It is so for many people. Because in this film there is one of the most meaningful acting Deceptions among the approximately 800 films I have watched. And that's Heath Ledger. What makes it meaningful is that he died after the movie was made. He Decamped from us 6 months before the film was released. He has such a performance in this film that his Wildcard character goes into a completely different dimension. Such performances are very few. One of the biggest advantages of the film is itself. Even though I've only watched this movie, my favorites are also at the beginning.

This series has brought a completely new style and atmosphere to superhero movies. The biggest part of this is Christopher Nolan's. He is my favorite director. All his films travel on the border of legends. Except for the first one or two movies. They are not bad either, just below their own performance. The director has also assembled such a cast that it is a very difficult cast to get together again. Dec. A very wide cast, from old legends to new stars.

As a Lord Of The Rings fan, I'm saying this by putting aside the entire series. It tops the best movies I've seen. I've watched a lot of movies, but I've never seen a movie as full of every second and loaded with meaning every second as this movie. There is not the slightest superfluous scene in the film. A movie that you should keep your eyes open and watch every second. Let this movie come to cinemas again now, I'll wait at the door in the morning and go to the first session. If a movie can give both so much action and so many messages at the same time, that movie is already a legend.",accord to what i believ what doesnt kill a person make him strang normal i had no intent of watch thi legend tonight when i came across it on a tv channel i got stuck on it then when i realiz how bad the dub wa and that the movi would not be watch in thi way i turn on my p format to watch the movi from the begin without ad and in it origin languag thi movi is at the begin of veri special movi for me it is so for mani peopl becaus in thi film there is one of the most meaning act decept among the approxim film i have watch and that heath ledger what make it meaning is that he die after the movi wa made he decamp from u month befor the film wa releas he ha such a perform in thi film that hi wildcard charact goe into a complet differ dimens such perform are veri few one of the biggest advantag of the film is itself even though ive onli watch thi movi my favorit are also at the begin thi seri ha brought a complet new style and atmospher to superhero movi the biggest part of thi is christoph nolan he is my favorit director all hi film travel on the border of legend except for the first one or two movi they are not bad either just below their own perform the director ha also assembl such a cast that it is a veri difficult cast to get togeth again dec a veri wide cast from old legend to new star a a lord of the ring fan im say thi by put asid the entir seri it top the best movi ive seen ive watch a lot of movi but ive never seen a movi a full of everi second and load with mean everi second a thi movi there is not the slightest superflu scene in the film a movi that you should keep your eye open and watch everi second let thi movi come to cinema again now ill wait at the door in the morn and go to the first session if a movi can give both so much action and so mani messag at the same time that movi is alreadi a legend,Neutral
"""The Dark Knight"" is a masterpiece of modern cinema and arguably one of the greatest superhero films ever made. Directed by Christopher Nolan and released in 2008, it is the second installment in Nolan's Batman trilogy and a sequel to ""Batman Begins."" Here's a review of this iconic film:

Story and Script (5/5): ""The Dark Knight"" boasts a compelling and morally complex storyline. The film delves deep into the psychology of its characters, especially Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), the Joker (Heath Ledger), and Harvey Dent/Two-Face (Aaron Eckhart). The script, penned by Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan, is taut and filled with memorable lines that add depth to the characters and the overall narrative.

Direction (5/5): Christopher Nolan's direction is impeccable. He brings a gritty and realistic tone to the superhero genre, grounding it in a way that was never seen before. The film's action sequences are brilliantly choreographed, and Nolan's use of IMAX cameras adds a sense of grandeur to the visuals.

Performance (5/5): Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is legendary. Ledger's performance is haunting, and he completely disappears into the character, earning him a posthumous Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Christian Bale's Batman is brooding and conflicted, while Aaron Eckhart delivers a standout performance as Harvey Dent. The entire ensemble cast, including Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon and Michael Caine as Alfred, is exceptional.

Visuals and Cinematography (5/5): Wally Pfister's cinematography is outstanding. The film's dark and moody aesthetic perfectly complements its tone, and the use of IMAX technology adds a cinematic grandeur to the action sequences. The practical effects and stunts also add to the film's authenticity.

Music (5/5): Hans Zimmer's score is iconic and unforgettable. The pounding, pulsating soundtrack enhances the tension and excitement of the film, and the Joker's theme is especially chilling.

Themes and Philosophy (5/5): ""The Dark Knight"" explores complex themes of morality, chaos, and the nature of heroism. It challenges the audience's perceptions of right and wrong and delves into the idea that sometimes the line between hero and villain is blurred.

Impact (5/5): Beyond being a box office success, ""The Dark Knight"" had a profound impact on the superhero genre and filmmaking as a whole. It elevated the genre to new heights and set a benchmark for storytelling, character development, and realism in superhero films.

In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic tour de force that transcends the boundaries of the superhero genre.

"Not a great Batman film fan because of the past films turning it into a dark farce, but I thought I would give this more serious one a go. At the start I quite enjoyed it. I like Bale and I liked the serious way of filming it where gravity did exist and the characters weren't capable of doing really stupid things, like Spiderman.

But it wasn't long before the story got a bit daft. A lot was happening that just started to ignore common sense. The story line just started to go anywhere as long as it got to the next part of the story. You constantly find yourself watching thinking ""but that wouldn't happen"".... Yeah its Batman, but when the story gets silly just to meet the outcome...well I kinda gave up on it.

The story was very...well...confusing. It kept jumping around trying to be all twisty and clever but it just made me feel aggravated. The scene jumping got madder and madder as time went on...and on...and on....

I soon found myself busting for the toilet, which got me wondering how long have I been watching this film for? This film is so bloated it is ridiculous. I kept thinking this next build up was the end...but then it just carried on. There are so many false horizons in this film it is unbelievable. This was one of those VERY rare times when I just wanted the film to end...I was begging it to end.

Hard to sum this one up, as all I wanted for it to do...was end. I stopped paying attention to the countless stupid attempts at a story twist...I just didn't care. From what I remember it was a shallow storyline that I just didn't buy into.

Now for my real moan...the high rating this film has on IMDb....evidence of more ratings corruption on this website. You used to be able to trust these film ratings but it appears that the marketing departments know exactly how to exaggerate these figures...which I find very annoying. IMDb...do something about this or risk losing your loyal visitors to this once highly regarded website.

Would I recommend this film....NO...too long and not worth the sore bum.",not a great batman film fan becaus of the past film turn it into a dark farc but i thought i would give thi more seriou one a go at the start i quit enjoy it i like bale and i like the seriou way of film it where graviti did exist and the charact werent capabl of do realli stupid thing like spiderman but it wasnt long befor the stori got a bit daft a lot wa happen that just start to ignor common sen the stori line just start to go anywher a long a it got to the next part of the stori you constantli find yourself watch think but that wouldnt happen yeah it batman but when the stori get silli just to meet the outcomewel i kinda gave up on it the stori wa verywellconfus it kept jump around tri to be all twisti and clever but it just made me feel aggrav the scene jump got madder and madder a time went onand onand on i soon found myself bust for the toilet which got me wonder how long have i been watch thi film for thi film is so bloat it is ridicul i kept think thi next build up wa the endbut then it just carri on there are so mani fals horizon in thi film it is unbeliev thi wa one of those veri rare time when i just want the film to endi wa beg it to end hard to sum thi one up a all i want for it to dowa end i stop pay attent to the countless stupid attempt at a stori twisti just didnt care from what i rememb it wa a shallow storylin that i just didnt buy into now for my real moanth high rate thi film ha on imdbevid of more rate corrupt on thi websit you use to be abl to trust these film rate but it appear that the market depart know exactli how to exagger these figureswhich i find veri annoy imdbdo someth about thi or risk lose your loyal visitor to thi onc highli regard websit would i recommend thi filmnotoo long and not worth the sore bum,Negative

"Seeing it rated as the third best movie of all time by IMDb voters, and ranking up huge box office, I thought I'd give it a swing.

I mostly wish I hadn't bothered. Like most super-hero movies nowadays, it's one gigantic battleship of a movie, weighed down by its humongous budget and massive running time. How many sub-plots do we need? How many conflicted characters, staring into the depths of their pompous souls? Visually - great. And the vfx crew have to be credited for some of the most seamless and impressive work ever done, on the city, the batmobile, the bat bike etc. Brilliant stuff.

But the story, the script, the pacing - all pretty blaah. Did I give a damn about any of the characters? Did I really care what was going to happen next? Nope. Did I actually know what was going on half the time, what with the various criminals, their money, the money laundering guy, the Joker, the various Police Departments (what the hell is ""County""?). No, no, no. Boring. I was actually looking at my watch.

The one intriguing episode in the film - with the ferries - is shoved in three quarters of the way through the film, and unceremoniously dumped once it has served its purpose in sticking other bits of the film together.

"This is the future comic book adaptations are headed? THEN WATCH...ME..GO. What a sucker punch. I had such a big hopes (mostly because of the hype created by people who invested millions into this flop), that it really hurts me to say, the biggest disappointment in 2008 was this movie. (Although, I still can't say it was the worst) There is nobody I can warn about this movie since I was probably the last person to see it on the earth, But-Man, to see a great franchise falling this low?! Millions of dollars spent on this movie, could have ended the poverty on this world, and I couldn't see anything to justify the spending. For example the bat-cave, in this movie is an undecorated, plain, underground garage. Fhuy!! Batman costumes always were lacking behind other super hero's outfit, however for what they used here, I have to admit I seen better on some kids showing up at my doorstep for Halloween. Not to mention it was so uncomfortable that Christian B. couldn't even move properly in it,(heck, he couldn't even speak properly in it), so all the fight scenes were TERRIBLE, hidden in dark or under a stroboscope light. How about the gay cowboy licking his mouth every 5 seconds, scary? try Retarded (No offense) Imitating raw home made camera footage, once invented by Blair Witch Project, in a News-break part was when I almost smashed my TV. (Again, where the money went in this film???????????????????????)

I'll tell You where. Paying all the critics for a few favorable words. Shame, on You Hollywood.

Sure, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher versions were Over-The-Top, But-Man, did I love their use of colors and mood, it was a visual treat.

Dark Knight: was it a bad movie?, No, it wasn't.

Disappointment? You betcha'a!

"""Batman"" isn't a comic book anymore. Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is a haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy. It creates characters we come to care about. That's because of the performances, because of the direction, because of the writing, and because of the superlative technical quality of the entire production. This film, and to a lesser degree ""Iron Man,"" redefine the possibilities of the ""comic-book movie.""

""The Dark Knight"" is not a simplistic tale of good and evil. Batman is good, yes, The Joker is evil, yes. But Batman poses a more complex puzzle than usual: The citizens of Gotham City are in an uproar, calling him a vigilante and blaming him for the deaths of policemen and others. And the Joker is more than a villain. He's a Mephistopheles whose actions are fiendishly designed to pose moral dilemmas for his enemies.

The key performance in the movie is by the late Heath Ledger, as the Joker. Will he become the first posthumous Oscar winner since Peter Finch? His Joker draws power from the actual inspiration of the character in the silent classic ""The Man Who Laughs"" (1928). His clown's makeup more sloppy than before, his cackle betraying deep wounds, he seeks revenge, he claims, for the horrible punishment his father exacted on him when he was a child. In one diabolical scheme near the end of the film, he invites two ferry-loads of passengers to blow up the other before they are blown up themselves. Throughout the film, he devises ingenious situations that force Batman (Christian Bale), Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to make impossible ethical decisions. By the end, the whole moral foundation of the Batman legend is threatened.

Because these actors and others are so powerful, and because the movie does not allow its spectacular special effects to upstage the humans, we're surprised how deeply the drama affects us. Eckhart does an especially good job as Harvey Dent, whose character is transformed by a horrible fate into a bitter monster. It is customary in a comic book movie to maintain a certain knowing distance from the action, to view everything through a sophisticated screen. ""The Dark Knight"" slips around those defenses and engages us.

Yes, the special effects are extraordinary. They focus on the expected explosions and catastrophes, and have some superb, elaborate chase scenes. The movie was shot on location in Chicago, but it avoids such familiar landmarks as Marina City, the Wrigley Building or the skyline. Chicagoans will recognize many places, notably La Salle Street and Lower Wacker Drive, but director Nolan is not making a travelogue. He presents the city as a wilderness of skyscrapers, and a key sequence is set in the still-uncompleted Trump Tower. Through these heights, the Batman moves at the end of strong wires, or sometimes actually flies, using his cape as a parasail.

The plot involves nothing more or less than the Joker's attempts to humiliate the forces for good and expose Batman' secret identity, showing him to be a poser and a fraud. He includes Gordon and Dent on his target list, and contrives cruel tricks to play with the fact that Bruce Wayne once loved, and Harvey Dent now loves, Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal). The tricks are more cruel than he realizes, because the Joker doesn't know Batman's identity. Heath Ledger has a good deal of dialogue in the movie, and a lot of it isn't the usual jabs and jests we're familiar with: It's psychologically more complex, outlining the dilemmas he has constructed, and explaining his reasons for them. The screenplay by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan (who first worked together on ""Memento"") has more depth and poetry than we might have expected.",batman isnt a comic book anymor christoph nolan the dark knight is a haunt film that leap beyond it origin and becom an engross tragedi it creat charact we come to care about that becaus of the perform becaus of the direct becaus of the write and becaus of the superl technic qualiti of the entir product thi film and to a lesser degre iron man redefin the possibl of the comicbook movi the dark knight is not a simplist tale of good and evil batman is good ye the joker is evil ye but batman pose a more complex puzzl than usual the citizen of gotham citi are in an uproar call him a vigilant and blame him for the death of policeman and other and the joker is more than a villain he a mephistophel whose action are fiendishli design to pose moral dilemma for hi enemi the key perform in the movi is by the late heath ledger a the joker will he becom the first posthum oscar winner sinc peter finch hi joker draw power from the actual inspir of the charact in the silent classic the man who laugh hi clown makeup more sloppi than befor hi cackl betray deep wound he seek reveng he claim for the horribl punish hi father exact on him when he wa a child in one diabol scheme near the end of the film he invit two ferryload of passeng to blow up the other befor they are blown up themselv throughout the film he devi ingeni situat that forc batman christian bale commission gordon gari oldman and district attorney harvey dent aaron eckhart to make imposs ethic decis by the end the whole moral foundat of the batman legend is threaten becaus these actor and other are so power and becaus the movi doe not allow it spectacular special effect to upstag the human were surpris how deepli the drama affect u eckhart doe an especi good job a harvey dent whose charact is transform by a horribl fate into a bitter monster it is customari in a comic book movi to maintain a certain know distanc from the action to view everyth through a sophist screen the dark knight slip around those defens and engag u ye the special effect are extraordinari they focu on the expect explos and catastroph and have some superb elabor chase scene the movi wa shot on locat in chicago but it avoid such familiar landmark a marina citi the wrigley build or the skylin chicagoan will recogn mani place notabl la sall street and lower wacker drive but director nolan is not make a travelogu he present the citi a a wilder of skyscrap and a key sequenc is set in the stilluncomplet trump tower through these height the batman move at the end of strong wire or sometim actual fli use hi cape a a parasail the plot involv noth more or less than the joker attempt to humili the forc for good and expo batman secret ident show him to be a poser and a fraud he includ gordon and dent on hi target list and contriv cruel trick to play with the fact that bruce wayn onc love and harvey dent now love assist da rachel daw maggi gyllenha the trick are more cruel than he realiz becaus the joker doesnt know batman ident heath ledger ha a good deal of dialogu in the movi and a lot of it isnt the usual jab and jest were familiar with it psycholog more complex outlin the dilemma he ha construct and explain hi reason for them the screenplay by christoph nolan and hi brother jonathan who first work togeth on memento ha more depth and poetri than we might have expect,Positive

"In the realm of superhero movies, there exists a pinnacle of excellence that stands head and shoulders above the rest: Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. Released in 2008, this film not only redefined the genre but also transcended it, delivering a gripping narrative, stellar performances, and thought-provoking themes that continue to resonate with audiences worldwide. As an ardent fan of The Dark Knight, I am thrilled to share my enthusiastic review of this cinematic masterpiece.

From the moment the opening scene unfolds, The Dark Knight captivates viewers with its atmospheric cinematography and haunting score. Nolan's Gotham City is a gritty and realistic backdrop, evoking a sense of urban decay and moral ambiguity. This serves as the perfect setting for the complex character dynamics that drive the story forward.

At the heart of The Dark Knight lies the conflict between the iconic hero Batman, portrayed with unparalleled gravitas by Christian Bale, and his enigmatic adversary, the Joker, brought to life in a chillingly mesmerizing performance by Heath Ledger. Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary, as he embodies the chaotic nature of the character with an intensity and unpredictability that is both captivating and unnerving. Every scene featuring the Joker crackles with tension, as he challenges Batman's moral code and pushes him to his limits.

But The Dark Knight is not merely a showdown between hero and villain; it is a deep exploration of the nature of heroism, justice, and the human psyche. The film delves into complex themes such as morality, sacrifice, and the blurred line between good and evil. Batman, burdened by the weight of his crusade against crime, must confront the darker aspects of his own identity as he battles against the Joker's nihilistic worldview.

One of the most compelling aspects of The Dark Knight is its examination of the concept of chaos versus order. The Joker represents pure chaos, an agent of anarchy who seeks to disrupt the established order and expose the hypocrisy of society. In contrast, Batman embodies the ideal of order and justice, striving to uphold a sense of morality and stability in the face of chaos. The dynamic between these two opposing forces drives much of the film's narrative tension, culminating in a series of gripping confrontations that challenge both characters on a fundamental level.

Beyond its thematic depth, The Dark Knight also excels in its technical craftsmanship. Nolan's direction is masterful, with each scene meticulously crafted to build tension and suspense. The action sequences are pulse-pounding and adrenaline-fueled, showcasing Batman's prowess as a formidable crimefighter. The film's visual effects are seamlessly integrated, immersing viewers in the dark and brooding atmosphere of Gotham City.

Furthermore, The Dark Knight boasts a stellar supporting cast, including standout performances from Aaron Eckhart as the idealistic district attorney Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as the steadfast Commissioner Gordon, and Morgan Freeman as the wise and resourceful Lucius Fox. Each actor brings depth and nuance to their respective roles, adding layers of complexity to the film's ensemble cast.

As a fan of The Dark Knight, I am continually impressed by its enduring legacy and cultural impact. More than a decade after its release, the film remains a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. Its themes of heroism, sacrifice, and the struggle for justice are as relevant today as they were upon its initial release.

In conclusion, The Dark Knight stands as a shining example of cinematic excellence, a film that transcends the confines of its genre to deliver a powerful and thought-provoking experience. From its gripping storyline to its unforgettable performances, Christopher Nolan's masterpiece is a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring appeal of the superhero mythos.

I thought that Christian Bale was miscast and unconvincing, as Batman and there really wasn't very much of a story line to the movie. I cannot understand how this is rated a 9 out of 10 at present.

"Sorry guys, but this doesn't belong in the top 250's by any account. Its fight scenes, car chases, its effects, and its storyline were all mostly average. Momentum wasn't built up over the film at all, and worse, they dragged out scenes longer then they should have.

In fact, this movie was in the top 250 list BEFORE it made it to cinema. Why? Because there are a few people who are overly enthusiastic about batman who used Heath's death as a marketing tool, over-hyped the movie and voted it upwards despite never having seen it. Just because a movie is based on a comic shouldn't mean it should be voted any differently (would anyone have liked this movie if Batman's costume was swapped). Yes, heath was good because he played something out of his general character, similar to how Jim Carrey did in Spotless mind. But...

"""The Dark Knight"" goes far beyond the label of a blockbuster or action film. Christopher Nolan crafts a powerful cinematic experience, confronting audiences with ethical and psychological dilemmas that stretch beyond the genre's conventions. Right from the start, the film challenges us to follow Batman in a struggle that goes beyond physical fights, diving deep into the dark territory of moral choices. More than a simple hero-villain face-off, Nolan shows just how much Bruce Wayne is driven-not by glory-but by a compulsive need to do what's right in a world where ""right"" is increasingly ambiguous. At its core, the film explores complex themes like sacrifice, surveillance, and the price of morality, redefining what to expect from a superhero adaptation.

The backbone of ""The Dark Knight"" is the dynamic between Batman and the Joker, portrayed iconically by Heath Ledger. Ledger's Joker is utterly disturbing, driven by a logic-defying impulse to expose humanity's fragility. This Joker embodies chaos in its purest form, revealing and manipulating Gotham's and Batman's vulnerabilities. More than an antagonist, he's a chaotic force that pushes Batman to question his own values, forcing him to confront the moral shadows of his own actions. The Joker imposes impossible dilemmas on Gotham and Batman alike, serving as a twisted mirror for Bruce Wayne's limitations and the clash between justice and obsession.

Christian Bale gives a gritty performance, turning Bruce Wayne into one of cinema's most complex characters. Instead of a perfect hero, his Batman is a man exhausted, torn between his commitment to protect Gotham and the personal toll of that mission. Bale brings a physicality to the role, using a raspy, intense voice under the cowl to express Batman's psychological weight. He masterfully balances the carefree playboy persona with the brooding vigilante, underscoring that Bruce is as masked in public as he is in the cape. In his interactions with the Joker, Bale conveys a complex mix of anger, frustration, and vulnerability, making him a powerful hero who struggles and wears down like anyone in Gotham. Bale's raw authenticity makes his Batman unforgettable, pushing beyond the superhero archetype into a movingly human portrayal.

The urban setting of Gotham becomes another main character, with a darkly realistic design heightened by cinematography that avoids over-the-top visuals while retaining the city's oppressive identity. Gotham is a battlefield where fear and corruption touch every scene, reflecting the complex morality of its residents. Each shot is carefully crafted to create a space where Batman is a dark vigilante and paradoxically vulnerable, as if the very place constantly reminds him of the impossibility of eradicating evil completely. Nolan makes Gotham a believable city where heroism meets real-world barriers, adding to the thick, intense atmosphere throughout the film.

Bruce Wayne's moral journey is heightened when he sees hope in Harvey Dent, believing him capable of carrying the weight of justice without turning to darkness. Aaron Eckhart plays Dent with idealistic energy that slowly breaks under pressure and tragedy, showing the fall of a ""White Knight"" into a haunting Two-Face. The story carefully parallels Dent's downfall with Batman's sacrifices, suggesting that even the purest heroes can be corrupted by pain and loss. This duality between Bruce and Dent deepens the story, and instead of simplifying the hero-villain theme, it builds complex characters who shift between light and shadow, highlighting the real cost of justice.

Nolan boldly takes on contemporary ethical questions, like surveillance and power boundaries, exploring just how far security can justify the loss of privacy. Batman's use of mass surveillance technology to catch the Joker raises the ends-versus-means debate. This decision creates one of the movie's most crucial conflicts, with Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) acting as a moral compass, challenging Batman's methods. The clash between safety and ethics lends the film a relevance that resonates beyond fiction, sparking reflections on society and the role of power in protection or oppression. Nolan's choice to include this conversation elevates ""The Dark Knight"" from action flick to critical commentary, raising questions that stick with viewers.

Technically, the film is flawless, with Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enriching the atmosphere with tension and emotional depth. The sound design is especially effective in Joker scenes, marked by a sharp, ominous sound that builds sinister anticipation before he even speaks. The action scenes, executed with realism and precision, are dynamic and visually impactful without overshadowing the plot or characters, always advancing the story. Nolan strategically uses every technical element to heighten the narrative, immersing viewers in Bruce Wayne's moral struggle-a vigilante constantly torn between his principles and actions.

In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" transcends the superhero genre by diving into themes of morality, sacrifice, and humanity's darker side. Nolan drives a narrative that challenges audiences to see beyond the battle of good versus evil, questioning the cost of being a hero in a world where justice and ethics often clash. Batman's final image, bearing Gotham's sins and fading into the shadows, is one of cinema's most iconic and melancholy shots, capturing the weight of his burden and the complexity of his role. Ultimately, the film stands as a masterpiece that redefines genre expectations, leaving a lasting mark on both superhero films and the cinematic landscape.",the dark knight goe far beyond the label of

"This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine.

"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a towering achievement in the realm of superhero cinema, transcending genre conventions to deliver a gripping and thought-provoking exploration of heroism, morality, and the nature of chaos. With its complex characters, thrilling action sequences, and profound themes, this film captivates audiences from beginning to end, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern cinema.

At the heart of ""The Dark Knight"" is Heath Ledger's mesmerizing performance as the Joker, one of the most iconic villains in cinematic history. Ledger's portrayal is nothing short of legendary, capturing the anarchic spirit of the character with a chilling intensity and magnetic charisma. His Joker is a force of nature, a chaotic agent who seeks to upend the established order and expose the hypocrisy and corruption that lurk beneath the surface of society.

Opposite Ledger's Joker stands Christian Bale's Batman, a brooding and conflicted figure grappling with his own inner demons and the moral complexities of his crusade against crime. Bale brings a quiet intensity to the role, imbuing Batman with a sense of gravitas and depth that grounds the film amidst its larger-than-life spectacle.

But ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a battle between hero and villain; it's a nuanced exploration of the blurred lines between good and evil, order and chaos. Nolan deftly weaves together multiple narrative threads, from the escalating conflict between Batman and the Joker to the ethical dilemmas faced by Gotham's law enforcement and political elite. The result is a film that is as intellectually stimulating as it is viscerally thrilling, challenging audiences to grapple with the complexities of morality and justice in a world plagued by corruption and violence.

Of course, ""The Dark Knight"" is also a technical marvel, with breathtaking action sequences, stunning visual effects, and a haunting score by Hans Zimmer that heightens the film's sense of tension and unease. Every frame is meticulously crafted, from the towering skyscrapers of Gotham City to the shadowy alleyways where the Dark Knight prowls.

In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a superhero movie; it's a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre to become a timeless work of art. Whether you're a fan of comic books or not, this is a film that demands to be seen and appreciated for its bold storytelling, impeccable craftsmanship, and profound thematic depth.",christoph nolan the dark knight stand a a tower achiev in the realm of superhero cinema transcend genr convent to deliv a grip and thoughtprovok explor of heroism moral and the natur of chao with it complex charact thrill action sequenc and profound theme thi film captiv audienc from begin to end leav an indel mark on the landscap of modern cinema at the heart of the dark knight is heath ledger mesmer perform a the joker one of the most icon villain in cinemat histori ledger portray is noth short of legendari captur the anarch spirit of the charact with a chill intens and magnet charisma hi joker is a forc of natur a chaotic agent who seek to upend the establish order and expo the hypocrisi and corrupt that lurk beneath the surfac of societi opposit ledger joker stand christian bale batman a brood and conflict figur grappl with hi own inner demon and the moral complex of hi crusad against crime bale bring a quiet intens to the role imbu batman with a sen of gravita and depth that ground the film amidst it largerthanlif spectacl but the dark knight is more than just a battl between hero and villain it a nuanc explor of the blur line between good and evil order and chao nolan deftli weav togeth multipl narr thread from the escal conflict between batman and the joker to the ethic dilemma face by gotham law enforc and polit elit the result is a film that is a intellectu stimul a it is viscer thrill challeng audienc to grappl with the complex of moral and justic in a world plagu by corrupt and violenc of cours the dark knight is also a technic marvel with breathtak action sequenc stun visual effect and a haunt score by han zimmer that heighten the film sen of tension and uneas everi frame is meticul craft from the tower skyscrap of gotham citi to the shadowi alleyway where the dark knight prowl in the end the dark knight is more than just a superhero movi it a cinemat masterpiec that transcend it genr to becom a timeless work of art whether your a fan of comic book or not thi is a film that demand to be seen and appreci for it bold storytel impecc craftsmanship and profound themat depth,Neutral
"The Dark Knight was most definitely one of the better movies I've had the pleasure of viewing and it did not fail to meet any preconceived notions or ideas which I formed already. Everything, from the phenomenal performance of the gifted set of actors to the amazing stunts and action executed, was beautifully and concisely produced. Starting with the actors and their performance, I believe that Heath Ledger was the best Joker the Batman Universe has yet to see; his expressed nuances and habits that he evokes to portray the Joker are something to be marveled. In one of the most famous scenes of not just the movie but of cinematic history, Heath Ledger poses the question to a mob leader while holding him at knife point: Why so serious? Heath Ledger was one of the best casting jobs of the movie. Another good casting job of the movie is of Christian Bale's. He plays Bruce Wayne/ Batman in The Dark Knight and he brings the mystery and reclusiveness and charisma that he embodies as both personalities. However, while I sing praises of the movie thus far, I don't feel as though it deserves a 10 of 10 as a score. There is a little amount of movie material that can be considered worthy of such a score and The Dark Knight is no exception.

2. Harvey Dent blames Batman for the death of Rachel. Why? He knows perfectly well that Batman is at least trying to be the hero here. So when Batman tells him to point the gun at the people responsible, why the heck does he point it at Batman??

"When I read the enthusiastic reviews in Italy and I saw this movie ranked 1st in the IMDb's Top 250, I thought: ""It's strange, the other Batman (Begins) was not so brilliant, what's happening with this sequel? Is it really this masterpiece? Is it really in the same league with movies like 'Clockwork Orange' or 'Apocalypse now'?"". No, it's not in the same league. Not at all. When I saw it, my delusion was strong. It's a good blockbuster action movie, but nothing more. Let's see.

The following comments contain spoilers. Be careful.

The script is not so original. There are tons of action sequences, but what can I say? I've seen it all. I've seen the robbery made by violent people, fighting against the guards and killing each others (in all pulp tradition, since ""Reservoir Dogs""). I've seen the ransom in China by plane (""Spy Games""). I've seen those action sequences with cars and armored vehicles in all American movies. (And this Batmobile is really awkward). I've seen the killer who kills by chance (""No Country for Old Men""). I've seen the super-mega-sadistic-mad-chaotic-evil-serial-killer in action who creates dilemmas and plays with his victims (in ""Seven"" and in the ""Saw"" saga). I've seen it all: ""The Dark Knight"" is nothing new. And it's very predictable: you really can predict any sequence before seeing it. There are a lot of absurdities. The heroes could kill The Joleker dozens of times, but they never do it. Why? Are they retarded? The ""two ships dilemma"" (I don't want to reveal more about that scene) is not realistic at all. There are only a couple of surprises, but the 2/3 of the movie doesn't create any suspense. What about the actors? The only two heroes of acting in this movie are Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart. Heath Ledger, with his Joker, bears quite the entire movie. All the other characters became secondary. Aaron Eckhart is really powerful and he confirms his talent shown in ""Thank You for Smoking"". What about the others? Christian Bale is one of the most talented actors of his generation, but in this movie he keeps only one expression all the time, with or without mask. His Batman has no personality. Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of the most interesting (and underrated) independent actresses of the New Hollywood, since ""The Secretary"". But in this movie she can act only in few sequences and she has no chance to show her real talent. Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane are giants, but in this movie they barely appear. Finally: I've never seen so many waste of talent! The good side of the coin in Christopher Nolan's work is: his philosophy. It's really positive and constructive and all his movie is coherent about it. It's just like the positive answer to ""No Country for Old Men"" and to modern nihilism: in the Cohen's movie, Evil is the absence of values and it's unstoppable.

"It surprises me that 12 years has passed since this film was released, and no other film of the super-hero genre have surpassed this one in terms of quality. Not one of the MCU, neither of the DCEU. Of course, we had great super-heroes films, but the Dark Knight have something else. I think it's the philosophical part. Not trying to be 'deep' or play the smart one, it's just the part that captivated me the most. The idea of Batman being the 'ugly hero', the monologue of Gordon in the ending of the film is outstanding and one of the reason I love Batman. Joker, that is heavily based on the version of the graphic novel Killing Joke of Alan Moore. The agent of chaos and anarchy that have a twisted vision of the world. The 'madness is like gravity' phrase have the same concept of this quote of The Killing Joke ""All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day."" Of course there's more than that, I loved Harvey Dent, Joker's 'social experiment' moment is just so powerful. The concept of a hero defeating the villain not with punchs and kicks, but proving that his view of world and ideology are both wrong, is just fantastic and I knew Christopher Nolan wouldn't gave us less than that.

About the rest, that makes this film even more interesting. Of course Nolan's directing, he's not that good at action sequences, but nothing you can't ignore. The amazing soundtrack of Hans Zimmer, his music brings the build-up necessary to increase the tension and adds more emotions to the film's most memorable moments. There's much more things that makes this film so great, but the charm is without doubt Heath Ledger's acting, a groundbreaking perfomance, he steals every scene he's in, he's charismatic, even portraying a sociopath, his laugh, the mannerisms, everything about his character is great. One of the few comic book films that are a masterpiece, but if they all were this good, gems like this film wouldn't as relevant as it is.",it surpris me that year ha pas sinc thi film wa releas and no other film of the superhero genr have surpass thi one in term of qualiti not one of the mcu neither of the dceu of cours we had great superhero film but the dark knight have someth el i think it the philosoph part not tri to be deep or play the smart one it just the part that captiv me the most the idea of batman be the ugli hero the monologu of gordon in the end of the film is outstand and one of the reason i love batman joker that is heavili base on the version of the graphic novel kill joke of alan moor the agent of chao and anarchi that have a twist vision of the world the mad is like graviti phrase have the same concept of thi quot of the kill joke all it take is one bad day to reduc the sanest man aliv to lunaci that how far the world is from where i am just one bad day of cours there more than that i love harvey dent joker social experi moment is just so power the concept of a hero defeat the villain not with punch and kick but prove that hi view of world and ideolog are both wrong is just fantast and i knew christoph nolan wouldnt gave u less than that about the rest that make thi film even more interest of cours nolan direct he not that good at action sequenc but noth you cant ignor the amaz soundtrack of han zimmer hi music bring the buildup necessari to increas the tension and add more emot to the film most memor moment there much more thing that make thi film so great but the charm is without doubt heath ledger act a groundbreak perfom he steal everi scene he in he charismat even portray a sociopath hi laugh the manner everyth about hi charact is great one of the few comic book film that are a masterpiec but if they all were thi good gem like thi film wouldnt a relev a it is,Positive

""" You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain""

Opening with a cunning master-show; a blisteringly devious bank heist that gives us the most iconic villain ever to grace the screen. A creepy Glasgow smile that keeps us up at night, spooking, haunting and endlessly projecting in our psyches for years and years, echoing from generation through generation. Everything holds up so well, in fact too well. The Dark Knight is a monolithic milestone of vigilante epicness, a hard-boiled crime noir masquerading as a PG-13 superhero movie, and a heroic ode for the ages.

Clap, Clap, Clap (in Joker's manner) for Nolan's ballistic nihilism, no holds barred mannerism and his spectacular vision has bequeathed us with multiple moral time-bombs, finely-tuned characterizations and dynamically explosive set-pieces: fake Batmans sequence, Harvey vs Rachel, 18-wheeler truck spinning and flipping upside down and Joker's brazenly blasting at the Batpod and so on. The villains have largely overpowered our hero in this one as darkness triumphantly cloaks up daylight, subverting the very foundation of comic-book genre, showing something we haven't seen before.

Similar to that magic pencil, The Dark Knight is relentless with its freakishly brutal power, casting an Abracadabra that's capable of knocking you out, mind-blown and ice cold on the floor. Dark and somber but equally rich in aesthetics, rainy Gotham City is as beautiful as it is immersive. So bleak there's almost no hope left and tensions are boisterously fueled by atmospheric dangers looming near, mercilessly raising the stakes up to 10000 degrees Celsius blazing fire. With many maze-like twists possessing such unpredictable nature similar to its crazy antagonist(s), this showdown is twistedly deranged, exciting and tragic in equal measures.

A film, so monumental, its impact cannot be understated. A film as bold and as ever-lasting as the immortal name it so tragically tells the story of.

An untouchable piece of fiction that brings great life to decades of graphic novel story-telling in unfathomably ground-breaking fashion. This is the power of undisputed directing champ Christopher Nolan.

He's Not Our Hero.

He's A Silent Guardian.

A Watchful Protector.

Heath Ledger is a truly psychotic Joker! As one of his final performances, he will be remembered as a villain who thrived on kaos and mayhem. Maggie Gyllenhall, Christain Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Aaron Erkhart all gave such Oomph to their roles. Technically, the movie was fantastic.

"""The Dark Knight"" is a movie that honors its title. Dark, twisted and complex, Christopher Nolan's latest wonder concerning Batman is a movie that sets a before and after in its genre and joins its perfect companion; its predecessor ""Batman Begins"". It had been a long time since I had seen so much adrenaline on a screen, but then again Nolan's Batman is what it is because it isn't just about the adrenaline.

It's still daylight in Gotham when a masterful opening sequence (supported by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer-again-magical score) gives way for a robbery to take place; organized by a man who calls himself The Joker (Heath Ledger), someone we would instantly take as a villain. If normally villains don't call themselves villains in superhero movies, this one says a lot of things about himself. He loves to talk and share his life philosophy with everyone he meets; he likes to joke, of course; he likes to watch people suffer with or without him watching; he dislikes rules and he likes Batman.

This last statement maybe more understood once you've watched the film, but there's one of Bruce Wayne (yes, Christian Bale IS Batman) many interesting conversations with Alfred (Michael Caine) in which they discuss the nature of The Joker, and the old man points out that maybe Bruce doesn't understand this villain in particular. There will be a moment of confrontation later in which the villain will tell the superhero: ""You complete me"". That phrase reminded me of the great movie ""Unbreakable"" is.

But, actually, what is a hero and what is a villain? In Nolan's brilliant screenplay (written with his brother Jonathan, a usual collaborator), full of psychological insight, this is one of the issues that floats over our head as we get lost in the ever exciting action sequences, fights and things blowing up in Nathan Crowley's spectacular production design.

""It's not what underlies you, but what you do that defines you"", a Rachel Dawes now played truthfully by Maggie Gyllenhaal told Bruce in ""Batman Begins"". Her words resonate, as Batman continues to fight evil with her, Gordon (Gary Oldman) and a new ally, the D.A. Harvey Dent (a superb Aaron Eckhart).

Let's not forget that Batman is more human than any of the other superheroes of the comic books. In this film, he's never able to call himself a hero and he thinks of quitting; without knowing if he's the guardian the city needs or deserves. But in all this realness, to continue watching him fall, to see him using his gadgets and his vehicles as a pro, to see that intelligence may surpass a gun to win a little fight or to generate fire without the need of any explosive; is one of ""The Dark Knight's"" treats to the viewer.

Another major treat for the viewer is the presence of a villain (or criminal, if you prefer, as The Joker refers to himself when he says the town ""deserves a better kind of criminal""-again the issue of deserving someone or not; a villain or a hero-) that equals Batman in human qualities. I don't mean that The Joker has principles we may admire (although many people will find inspiring things in his weirdness), I'm simply referring to the fact that he doesn't fly through the air or owns magic powers and he just uses what he has in hand to serve some kind of purpose.

Heath Ledger steals the film (and will get an Oscar nomination, because dreaming has no cost) and makes a wonderful Joker, mainly, because he embraces this human aspect of the character Christian Bale understood so well in ""Batman Begins"". Without overacting, Ledger creates an individual that we can call a freak, because it's the first thing that crosses our mind when we meet him. He has all this makeup in his face and two scars; he has a lot of stories to explain the origin of these scars. Ledger tells every story convincingly, and leaves no room for the viewer to fully understand him. His character has no name, nor he possesses the background story we see many times with heroes and villains; however we get to perceive an amount of grimness in his look and we want to know exactly where it comes from. It's Heath Ledger's great acting what generates all this.

The rest of the ensemble, as in ""Batman Begins"", is top-notch. Michael Caine is given more screen time and makes the best of it; so does the great Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman. There are surely many other perspectives in which the film can be viewed and discussed, and that reflects the very good piece Nolan has created; a movie that's profound in the best sense of the wordA word we don't use so much for comic book movies.

AnywayBatman may not know if he's the protector Gotham needs or deserves, but ""The Dark Knight"" is undoubtedly the superhero movie the film-goer deserves and has been waiting for since its predecessor; a film that even someone who knows nothing about comics, like me, celebrates with a big smileWhy so serious?",the dark knight is a movi that honor it titl dark twist and complex christoph nolan latest wonder concern batman is a movi that set a befor and after in it genr and join it perfect companion it predecessor batman begin it had been a long time sinc i had seen so much adrenalin on a screen but then again nolan batman is what it is becaus it isnt just about the adrenalin it still daylight in gotham when a master open sequenc support by jame newton howard and han zimmeragainmag score give way for a robberi to take place organ by a man who call himself the joker heath ledger someon we would instantli take a a villain if normal villain dont call themselv villain in superhero movi thi one say a lot of thing about himself he love to talk and share hi life philosophi with everyon he meet he like to joke of cours he like to watch peopl suffer with or without him watch he dislik rule and he like batman thi last statement mayb more understood onc youv watch the film but there one of bruce wayn ye christian bale is batman mani interest convers with alfr michael cain in which they discus the natur of the joker and the old man point out that mayb bruce doesnt understand thi villain in particular there will be a moment of confront later in which the villain will tell the superhero you complet me that phrase remind me of the great movi unbreak is but actual what is a hero and what is a villain in nolan brilliant screenplay written with hi brother jonathan a usual collabor full of psycholog insight thi is one of the issu that float over our head a we get lost in the ever excit action sequenc fight and thing blow up in nathan crowley spectacular product design it not what underli you but what you do that defin you a rachel daw now play truth by maggi gyllenha told bruce in batman begin her word reson a batman continu to fight evil with her gordon gari oldman and a new alli the da harvey dent a superb aaron eckhart let not forget that batman is more human than ani of the other superhero of the comic book in thi film he never abl to call himself a hero and he think of quit without know if he the guardian the citi need or deserv but in all thi real to continu watch him fall to see him use hi gadget and hi vehicl a a pro to see that intellig may surpass a gun to win a littl fight or to gener fire without the need of ani explos is one of the dark knight treat to the viewer anoth major treat for the viewer is the presenc of a villain or crimin if you prefer a the joker refer to himself when he say the town deserv a better kind of criminalagain the issu of deserv someon or not a villain or a hero that equal batman in human qualiti i dont mean that the joker ha principl we may admir although mani peopl will find inspir thing in hi weird im simpli refer to the fact that he doesnt fli through the air or own magic power and he just use what he ha in hand to serv some kind of purpos heath ledger steal the film and will get an oscar nomin becaus dream ha no cost and make a wonder joker mainli becaus he embrac thi human aspect of the charact christian bale understood so well in batman begin without overact ledger creat an individu that we can call a freak becaus it the first thing that cross our mind when we meet him he ha all thi makeup in hi face and two scar he ha a lot of stori to explain the origin of these scar ledger tell everi stori convincingli and leav no room for the viewer to fulli understand him hi charact ha no name nor he possess the background stori we see mani time with hero and villain howev we get to perceiv an amount of grim in hi look and we want to know exactli where it come from it heath ledger great act what gener all thi the rest of the ensembl a in batman begin is topnotch michael cain is given more screen time and make the best of it so doe the great morgan freeman and gari oldman there are sure mani other perspect in which the film can be view and discus and that reflect the veri good piec nolan ha creat a movi that profound in the best sen of the word a word we dont use so much for comic book movi anyway batman may not know if he the protector gotham need or deserv but the dark knight is undoubtedli the superhero movi the filmgoer deserv and ha been wait for sinc it predecessor a film that even someon who know noth about comic like me celebr with a big smile whi so seriou,Positive
"The Dark Knight is based upon the Batman characters created by Bob Kane and is a follow up to 2005's Batman Begins. I remember in some earlier reviews of mine this year that I stated that I didn't even know if I would end up going to see The Dark Knight. After giving Batman Begins a perfect rating on this site you are probably wondering why I wouldn't want to see a sequel to a film I enjoyed so much. Well, when I saw Batman Begins in the theatres I thought it had a lot of style, action and kept me compelled and entertained and I found it a really good time at the movies. Hence the perfect review I gave it three years ago. Then, I saw it again on DVD and I did not like it at all. The thrills and excitement were gone and everything that held up so well the first time had vanished and rather than seeing all the good things I enjoyed about it on my first viewing, instead on my second viewing I found parts of it boring and I started to have a few problems with the acting performances. I still kept the rating on this site to a 10 because that was my first initial reaction to the film, but after not enjoying the film much at all seeing it a second time and having been entirely sick and tired of all the superhero films coming out this year I really couldn't have cared less if I saw The Dark Knight at all. Then all of the really good reviews for the film came pouring in all over the internet and I kept hearing how dark and bleak this version was and I even heard of one critic who couldn't recommend the film because of how dark it was. This intrigued me because I have always been a fan of darker fare and the fact that family members saw the film and told me that I would really like it ended up in me seeing it. And to my surprise I thought it was as close to perfect as a superhero film could possibly get and I would most certainly call it a masterpiece. The acting was all top notch from every performer involved especially by the late Heath Ledger who played the role of the Joker. I have seen Heath Ledger in other films such as Brokeback Mountain, or I'm Not There and to play this role he isn't more or less playing himself, but instead going totally out of character and playing a twisted and menacing psychopath and everything the Joker says, does and the evil in his facial expressions show that he is a true terrorizing evil. All of this is perfected by Heath Ledger who gives the best performance of this year so far and I would compare his performance as the Joker to last year's best performance of Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood. Day Lewis won an Oscar this year, so I see no reason why Heath Ledger couldn't get nominated, or even win the award in his memory seeing as he tragically passed away earlier in the spring. His performance was one of the best parts of the film. What was also so good about the film besides the top notch acting, direction and cinematography was it's story. Instead of being filled by non stop explosions, high tech gadgets and over blown self indulgent special effects, this film instead mostly focused on the characters and for each one involved we are driven deep into their minds to see the madness of the villains and the good and also troubled lives of the others including Batman himself. The character study here is so fascinating that anyone taking a sociology or psychology course couldn't help, but be interested. The story in the film had me drawn in from start to finish and I liked the menacing and dark tone to the film which I found all the more interesting and I liked how this film did not use formulas, or clichés and instead gave us a straight out story that you would not know how it ended till the end credits rolled. The Dark Knight really hit me and made an impression on me. Even days after leaving the theatre I 'am still thinking about the film and certain scenes and characters in it. This is what I call a powerful, thought provoking and stay with you film that is so good that it has almost a power to remain in your mind like this.

"Although an average film, ""Batman Begins"" had a dark, brooding quality and got off to an interesting start about the origins of the caped crusader before turning dreary. Unfortunately, this followup takes up right where the previous one left off - still dark but also dreary and even sillier. The script is atrocious and the plot line involving Two-Face is unbelievably lame. The most interesting thing in this tiresome film is the mesmerizing farewell performance from Ledger. He is simply fun to watch as the Joker. All the other actors look bored, a result of Nolan's dull direction. At a length of two and a half hours, it seriously overstays its welcome.

"Two things interesting about this for me. (I'll let others talk about Heath.)

One is how much more of a comic book it is than a film. I don't mean that it is sillier or more fantastic, but that the values seem to be based on storyboards as panels. The implications are pretty interesting. All those Marvel productions are pretty much the same: the same level of fantasy, the same vocabulary of cinematic effects. The same slant from ""graphic novel"" framing to modern film traditions  which incidentally are less designed than are the accidents of common CGI compositing tools.

This on the other hand is not cinematic. It makes it boring for me visually, but there's another result: the story. The story is not your standard long form arc. Its at least four stories concatenated, as if you would read a few pages and come back at the next lunch break. It rambles, it has real comicbook soap opera. I really do think of this as a comic book that accidentally finds itself in a film.

That's as opposed to ""Sin City,"" which though based on a comic, and supposedly co- directed by the comic artist, is intensely cinematic, so much so you almost drown.

The other feature for me: the handling of noir.

Noir is all about how the viewer manipulates the action by viewing. It has permeated nearly every corner of film and most intelligent filmmakers try to play with it. It is the primary narrative tool we have to add depth by adding layers. The Nolans are intelligent filmmakers. While the film isn't very cinematic, the script is, in this regard.

The novel trick here is the joker. Sure he is played well, and Ledger was becoming one of our foremost folded actors. But the thing works because the role was written to matter, and that's because he introduces a double noir fold. The watcher is in the film, and the watcher is ""writing"" the script regardless of any action that anyone in the film can take. Its classic noir doubled. The joker's key speeches even cover all the noir highlights: you have to ruin routine; you have to profoundly affect, even kill random innocents; you have to express an amazingly complex orchestration and make it seem capricious, accidental. You have to deny intent and complexity. You have to pretend to not be amused.

All these things are embodied in what Ledger was given. This is very important writing, and if you know ""Prestige"" and ""Memento,"" even ""Following,"" you would have expected something like this. Even if the film isn't good as a film, the writing is, and that allows Heath to make a film within. Its why ""Clockwork Orange"" is so important.

"There is a pantheon of movies that define a generation. Star Wars, The Godfather, Jaws and now, The Dark Knight. A cinematic masterpiece, the films 2 and a half hours are both too short, yet so immersing it seems like days. Not one frame of wasted celluloid was included. The cinematography was unbelievable with sweeping cityscapes and intense, explosive action sequences. The acting was also unbelievable; Between Heath Ledger's tour de force (which is definitely deserving of the Oscar buzz), Aaron Eckhart's tragic Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Gary Oldman's ever brilliant presence as Lt. James Gordan, and Christian Bale's intense and driven Batman/Bruce Wayne, everyone involved is absolutely stellar. However, what truly makes this film the cinematic event that it is, is the story. Truly epic in it's scope but always aware that personal tragedy is what drives it. This is a rare cinematic masterpiece in a time where summer movies have come to mean mindless fluff, this transcends the typical superhero movie to achieve something truly spectacular. Seeing this film was an experience that I will not soon forget and I truly hope others derive the same pleasure from seeing it that I did.",there is a pantheon of movi that defin a gener star war the godfath jaw and now the dark knight a cinemat masterpiec the film and a half hour are both too short yet so immers it seem like day not one frame of wast celluloid wa includ the cinematographi wa unbeliev with sweep cityscap and intens explos action sequenc the act wa also unbeliev between heath ledger tour de forc which is definit deserv of the oscar buzz aaron eckhart tragic harvey denttwofac gari oldman ever brilliant presenc a lt jame gordan and christian bale intens and driven batmanbruc wayn everyon involv is absolut stellar howev what truli make thi film the cinemat event that it is is the stori truli epic in it scope but alway awar that person tragedi is what drive it thi is a rare cinemat masterpiec in a time where summer movi have come to mean mindless fluff thi transcend the typic superhero movi to achiev someth truli spectacular see thi film wa an experi that i will not soon forget and i truli hope other deriv the same pleasur from see it that i did,Positive
"seems like the comment on the front page was written by someone who must of been paid by the studio, Jesus! It wasn't that good dude! Get a life or at least get out of Malaysia! The movie was trying to be too many things. It should of focused more on just being a action movie and not so much psychodrama! Heath was brilliant but Nicholsons Batman was also great. I couldn't see myself watching this again. Once was enough! And the Batmobile was down right bizarre. It didn't look like something created by a rich man like Bruce Wayne. I liked the performance of Eric Roberts as well as Heath Ledgers. I believe the last batman was better. 7/10

"This movie has everything. The cameras, the sounds, the really cool characters. For me, it's one of few adventure movies worth watching more than once. And, of course, Heath Ledger is as awesome as everyone says. The characterization is so much deeper than the other films. We get to see multidimensional people with purpose, even if the purpose to to kill and maim. We care about what happens for a change and we go along for the ride. A small criticism is that it is awfully long and it takes so much time to resolve itself. Also, people do some pretty stupid things, considering what a threat this guy is. These are little things and without them we wouldn't have the huge finale.",thi movi ha everyth the camera the sound the realli cool charact for me it one of few adventur movi worth watch more than onc and of cours heath ledger is a awesom a everyon say the character is so much deeper than the other film we get to see multidimension peopl with purpos even if the purpos to to kill and maim we care about what happen for a chang and we go along for the ride a small critic is that it is aw long and it take so much time to resolv itself also peopl do some pretti stupid thing consid what a threat thi guy is these are littl thing and without them we wouldnt have the huge final,Neutral
"The Dark Knight. Spectacular , stunning and amazing. Absolutely staggering, a film that is not going to be forgotten. One that actually shows a story as it was meant to be shown, and one of the most darkest, cruelest, and violent action-packed films ever created. With great dialogues in between the equally great scenes, taking the film to another level of greatness.

The special effects were all done in a simple, non shabby way, the soundtracks were simply harmonizing with the picture, and the Gotham we knew is now gone, this is a darker and more corrupt place than in any of the previous films.

Moving on to the acting. Starting off with the Dark Knight. Bale's performance was outstanding, no-one else has ever been as superb a Batman as he is. Him being split between righteousness and insanity, between what is right and what is wrong. An entirely different Batman, and Bruce Wayne, surpassing any of his other predecessors. Whilst those were more flat, two sided characters, the Bruce Wayne we face in The Dark Knight, is a totally different story.

Two key people in the film were also Det. Lt. James Gordon, who was played by Gary Oldman, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. They both gave a good, very believable performance. Same would go to the two characters in the supporting roles, Alfred and Luscious fox, being cast by Micheal Caine and Morgan Freeman. Whilst these all gave a good quality from themselves, I was not at all impressed by Maggie Gyllenhaal who played Rachel Daws.

Whether these characters were played well or not, people just could not concentrate on them too much, and that is only because of the fact that Heath Ledger, as the Joker, simply dominated every scene he was in, he was the highlight of the whole film. This is no ordinary Joker we were used to, Ledger portrayed the Joker as someone with hate running through his veins, someone that killed for pleasure and someone who had felt a great loss in his past. A darker, sicker, and more evil Joker than any of the other ones in the previous films. Insane, corrupt and terrifying, with a laugh of a psychotic maniac. A perfect villain for the Dark Knight, one that truly completed, and challenged him through the whole story. Hats down for Heath Ledger.

Now, not to give all the compliments for the fantastic job to the actors. I also have to compliment the Nolan brothers for an obviously marvellous screenplay and great directing. Not to forget for a large stack of brilliant dialogues. They make films immortal, in a way that they are never forgotten. It makes the difference between a quality film and a masterpiece. The Dark Knight is a masterpiece, amazing performances by the actors, with special mention on Ledger as the Joker. Bone-chilling scenes combined with action and drama, in Gotham that looks flawless, a huge city covered with darkness and insanity.

"I really wanted to see this in the theater;however, I never did last summer. Instead I waited till it came on cable, and after watching it; I really didn't miss anything by not going to the theater. I was rather disappointed because I was expecting this to be as good as Spiderman, but I don't think it was. I thought it was rather slow moving with sparse action scenes. I mean Batman on the chopper really wasn't that much action. A lot of films have had better car chasing scenes then that.

And I really didn't think Heath Ledger was anything special in this. His role was just a lot of hype. Probably the best role was by Aaron Eckhart and the special effects with his face at the end.

I also have to comment on Christian Bale's Batman voice. What was he trying to do?? He sounded like a chronic smoker with emphysema.

FINAL VERDICT: It was good, just not as good as advertised. I don't get why so many people thought it was the best comic book movie to be made.",i realli want to see thi in the theaterhowev i never did last summer instead i wait till it came on cabl and after watch it i realli didnt miss anyth by not go to the theater i wa rather disappoint becaus i wa expect thi to be a good a spiderman but i dont think it wa i thought it wa rather slow move with spar action scene i mean batman on the chopper realli wasnt that much action a lot of film have had better car chase scene then that and i realli didnt think heath ledger wa anyth special in thi hi role wa just a lot of hype probabl the best role wa by aaron eckhart and the special effect with hi face at the end i also have to comment on christian bale batman voic what wa he tri to do he sound like a chronic smoker with emphysema final verdict it wa good just not a good a advertis i dont get whi so mani peopl thought it wa the best comic book movi to be made,Negative
"Too long, too dark, and too serious. The darkness is unavoidable - but exacerbated by the length, and the fact that for a movie about a superhero, it is entirely too serious. No matter how hard we try, the idea of a superhero is still a bit crazy. Imagine Bill Gates or Warren Buffet as superheroes - it's silly. So why does the film take itself so seriously? Also, it seems that the Batman story slips to the side in parts, as though the film is intent on tackling too many issues all at once. This isn't said to be contrary - the movie can be legitimately difficult to watch. It's simply too long for the content. It's not a bad film - but it's not an all-time great either.",too long too dark and too seriou the dark is unavoid but exacerb by the length and the fact that for a movi about a superhero it is entir too seriou no matter how hard we tri the idea of a superhero is still a bit crazi imagin bill gate or warren buffet a superhero it silli so whi doe the film take itself so serious also it seem that the batman stori slip to the side in part a though the film is intent on tackl too mani issu all at onc thi isnt said to be contrari the movi can be legitim difficult to watch it simpli too long for the content it not a bad film but it not an alltim great either,Neutral
"Okay, so they built a good villain in the Joker, but the plot was just a bit too unbelievable to hold together. I'm not going to add any spoilers here, but if you want a big-budget, action- adventure escape that totally relies on the rendering farms that had to handle all the special effects... and don't mind plot-holes the Hindenburg could fly through, this film is for you.

IMHO, this film doesn't deserve all the hype. Look at reviews from people who ""hated it"" and see why. Once the hype has died down and people get over their brainwash to overrate this over-produced Hollywood crap, we should see ratings more in line with the film's true value. I didn't walk out, but that was because I had such high expectations. I'd hope to see this rated a '4', maybe even as high as a '6' by the average public. I'm rating this a '1' to try to offset the obvious shills and excessive hype. This is, by no means, ""the best film of the summer""... but in its favor, it does give better balance to the darkness of Batman. If it weren't for the growing trend in bucking the old ""feel-good Hollywood ending"" routine... if it weren't becoming cliché to kill off ""good guys"" and create characters with seeming hearts of gold, who turn half-evil, I'd say this film had something unique; but that whole scenario is now a formula for making a film armchair critics will say has ""depth""... pffff...

"The Dark Knight serves as both the title of the film, and as its final purpose (i.e., its a play on the phrase, ""White Knight."") At the essence of this film is an extremely simple story, complicated (rather enhanced) by a series of developments triggered by the introduction of said ""Dark Knight"" in the previous film. And their consequences.

The core of the movie is Bruce Wayne - originally having intended to serve as a hero for a time - desperately clinging to the hope of Rachel Dawes, and her promise of waiting for him, in the last chapter. But her heart is elsewhere. On the flip-side; everything is troubled by the inner-workings of a clown-apparent madman without a purpose.

Christian Bale is exceptional here; playing the role of both Batman and Bruce Wayne differently (one of the only actors to ever realize that in the role) and both are played with equal confliction and brooding, building on the same promise shown in ""Batman Begins."" Aaron Eckhardt, on the flip-side of the coin (pun intended), is the obviously-inspired presentation of Harvey Dent like Elliot Ness in ""The Untouchables."" He is doomed to misery and scarring, of course, from the first reel and - strangely - every scene with him in it carries that pre-established foreboding. Perhaps intentionally. And Maggie Gyllenhaal does well in a role that was poorly-written last time and difficult to really care about. In the end, he comes through and enhances a role that comes off bland on paper. The rest of the cast is exceptional as well. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Eric Roberts all shine spectacularly in this ensemble cast.

But the true star of the show is Heath Ledger. From the first reel of the film in which he leads a scene that starts the show with a bang, to the end credits; the actor and the man who was Heath Ledger is nowhere to be found. He disappears into the role with an intensity that you would not expect in - what is ultimately - a superhero movie. I have seen the film three times now and each time I notice something else in the performance. For instance, every line that he utters has a strange comical side of it. Whether its threatening someone's life, giving a rendition of his ""violent history"" or simply antagonizing Batman; every line is strangely funny and unnerving at the same time. Its also note-worthy that in performing a rendition of the iconic Joker far and away from his comic book origins; he ironically nails the best depiction of the Joker to date. Yes, surpassing even the likes of Mark Hammil.

I found it interesting how they interweaved the Joker into the plot. Without spoiling anything; the Joker exists outside of the entire structure of the film and, truthfully, could have been easily removed and still maintain a tangible film. It almost reminded me of the intentional-writing on ""The Sixth Sense"" where (again, without spoiling anything) Bruce Willis' character exists in the movie with that same ""interchangeable"" involvement. This increases the entire scope of the Joker because, as a self-proclaimed ""agent of anarchy""; he even exists within the reel of film as the embodiment of chaos.

Christopher Nolan comes through yet again. One of the things I was hoping walking in was that the movie would be more urban than ""Begins"", which was more wrapped up with mythology than action and deeing the Batman in action. This time, we start off running with Batman finishing some business from the last movie. He keeps the film on the brink Another interesting thing I noticed about the film is that EVERY character is developed by the end of it. At first glance, all of the characters, second-billing and less, comes off extremely cardboard cut-out and one-dimensional. Surprisingly, throughout the course of the film, each and every one of them have their little story arcs that flesh out their characters.

Perhaps this is why the movie has an epic feeling that surpasses the vast hype surrounding it. Having seen it three times in the theater, and ""other places"" (*waves at the Internet police*) I find myself hard-pressed to find a legitimate gripe about the movie. I have been sitting here this entire time trying to find one - and I can't. It is a taut, hard-boiled crime-thriller and mystery that happens to have a superhero at the thick of it; which is exactly how a Batman movie should work. Most of the film is even strangely realistic, in an unsettling way.

Probably the finest movie of the year and a legitimate masterpiece.

"A new villain is in town and he's a homicidal clown known as The Joker. Batman must do everything in his power to stop him, while Harvey Dent takes the lime light as the new face of good.

Not since The Matrix Reloaded have I been hyped to see a film. Where Reloaded failed to deliver on that hype, The Dark Knight soars with bright colours. Is it everything that a Batman fan wants it to be? Yes. Is it everything a film lover wants it to be? Yes. The Dark Knight takes you on a ride through action, suspense, humour and drama. It rests in a genre that makes you suspend a little reality. This is the comic book world, where there are green monsters, flying men in tights and teenagers swinging around in New York. Very bright, very over the top and very fun. The Dark Knight turns all of this on it's head and delivers a raw, realistic and genre defining film. Along with Iron Man, The Dark Knight sets a new standard for comic book adaptations.

Without a doubt, every review the one will read will praise the chaotic energy that Heath Ledger gives in the role of The Joker. Can a role really live up to such hype? Yes, and this is it. Heath Ledger goes where many people do not. He becomes the character, he becomes the Joker. Nicholson played the part well, but Ledger embodies it. Every little quirk, from the flicker in the eyes, raising the eyebrows or using his tongue to wet his lips, draws you into the character. It's safe to say the Ledger does indeed steal the show from everyone and the film knows this too. It's a shame we will never see where Ledger career would have gone, because this role is juicy and Ledger nails it.

That's not to say that everyone else isn't good either. Bale brings more tragedy into the heart of both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Even with the world around him crumbling down, he still stands for good. Michael Cain reaches more depths with simple looks in his eyes. Both Alfred and Fox have moral dilemmas in this film, both play them well. Oldman has more screen time here then he did in Begins and he takes the character of Gordon to new heights. We know him as a good cop that doesn't conform to the corruption, but here his range explodes into more emotional decision making. Aaron Eckhart has the most troubling task here. He must play two completely different roles, within the same character, and we have to believe the transformation. His anger and hate mixes well with his confusion in what to do after his 'accident'. Finally Gyllenhaal, replaces Holmes. The character finally has some more range, but Gyllenhaal doesn't get enough screen time to bring it to us. Again, it's sad to say but this is the weakest link. It may just simply be the character.

Everything about this film hits the nail on the head. The acting is top notch, no longer are roles in comic book films cheesy or one dimensional. These character are psychotic, dangerous, funny, defenseless and everything more you can ask for. Back when these characters could never be taken seriously, now are awing us with their presence. The script is fabulous. Every line of dialogue spoken by The Joker is chilling, now times that by ten because Ledger somehow gives the lines more chills. The action sequences are entertaining. We have car chases, fight scenes, race against the clock bits and anything else The Joker can come up with. With ever scheme he tops himself in the absurdity and craziness. More action then it's predecessor, more drama, more villainous and more dark. This isn't your Adam West Batman. This is Nolan's Batman.

Nolan has recreated what once was lost. When nipples and bad ice puns were where these characters were, now are set back in the right motion. Nolan has given us, not only the best Batman movie, but the best comic book movie. You don't need high theatrics to create a great comic book film, you need substance. The Dark Knight has boatloads of this. I found myself wanting more of the Joker, I was so enthralled by the character and the performance. I found myself in awe of where the film goes, in terms of plot and character development. I applaud Nolan for not making a happy go lucky film, but for given The Dark Knight his true colours. He's a tormented soul, the events in this film push him to the limit, to his breaking point.

There are some minor setbacks though. I wasn't too thrilled with the bits in Hong Kong. Trims here and there could have saved the running time, which clocks in at 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes. As well as too many scene where the camera decides to spin around the characters a couple times, it gets a tad annoying.

The Dark Knight will break barriers. Comic book films will be more serious, more character and plot driven then CGI laden. Heath Ledger will earn an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a sick and twisted clown. People will want to see what happens in this world and the people in it.

"Don't let the title mislead you, I am not going to bash the movie, actually this movie is good, only that the hype over the internet(Heath's death and the Batman fan-support) effected the movies overall rating too much.

I said this is a good movie. But is it the best ? Not even close. In its own category, it dominates most of the movies though, probably as good as Ironman and better than the first movie. Like most of the people, I am satisfied with the film but there are a few criticisms that I can make, about the fighting sequences, jokers screen time, and the process of the movie.

First I wonder, why this film isn't called ""Joker""? Not only that Heath overshadows everyone with his performance, he also has incredible screen time as well, it is as if we are watching Joker as the main character, everything revolves around him. Maybe It was because there were too many characters in the movie, with separate goals and purposes, which also effected the process of the movie in my opinion. The story sometimes advanced too slow and sometimes too fast(but too fast in general) not allowing you to digest the theme fully.

One other thing is the fighting sequences, the careography was not well made, most of the time it was too blunt, too dark and because of that, hard to perceive. Maybe it was the directors intention, but it kinda disturbed me, not being able to understand what was going on.

To sum up it, the movie was just like I expected, but obviously below its hype, with a few deficiencies, a good movie in overall but definitely not a master piece.",dont let the titl mislead you i am not go to bash the movi actual thi movi is good onli that the hype over the internetheath death and the batman fansupport effect the movi overal rate too much i said thi is a good movi but is it the best not even close in it own categori it domin most of the movi though probabl a good a ironman and better than the first movi like most of the peopl i am satisfi with the film but there are a few critic that i can make about the fight sequenc joker screen time and the process of the movi first i wonder whi thi film isnt call joker not onli that heath overshadow everyon with hi perform he also ha incred screen time a well it is a if we are watch joker a the main charact everyth revolv around him mayb it wa becaus there were too mani charact in the movi with separ goal and purpos which also effect the process of the movi in my opinion the stori sometim advanc too slow and sometim too fastbut too fast in gener not allow you to digest the theme fulli one other thing is the fight sequenc the careographi wa not well made most of the time it wa too blunt too dark and becaus of that hard to perceiv mayb it wa the director intent but it kinda disturb me not be abl to understand what wa go on to sum up it the movi wa just like i expect but obvious below it hype with a few defici a good movi in overal but definit not a master piec,Negative
"No words can quite aptly describe the dark, sinuous genius of Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"". A sequel to the 2005 ""Batman Begins"", the film defies the industry cliché of being a shameless exploitation of a franchise.

Much has already been said about Heath Ledger's electric performance as the demented Joker and little else can really be said. It's a performance that displays every psychological tic with sadistic glee and Ledger, virtually unrecognisable behind both the makeup and the mannerisms, imbues his character with terrifying insanity.

Of course, Ledger is just one of the many gems in a fine cast. Christian Bale is predictably good in the titular role but he's overshadowed by some other key players. Maggie Gyllenhaal is good as are Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman but it's Aaron Eckhart who gives a truly amazing performance as Harvey Dent, Gotham's idealistic DA and the city's moral centre. Eckhart's innocuous golden boy looks belie his dramatic finesse and he conveys the duality of Harvey's character and ideals with great deft.

The high calibre of the cast is reason enough to go see the movie but it's the screenplay, written by the Nolan Brothers, that allows ""The Dark Knight"" to become more than just an adequate sequel. For all the cartoonish connotations of its comic book origins, the movie is a rich and fascinating study into the machinations of justice and humanity. In a genre of such formulaic conventions where ""doomed romance"" and ""final showdown"" are automatically entrenched in the storyline to inspire the same old message and emotions, it's hard to find some new ground. ""The Dark Knight"" succeeds, however, in toying with these very conventions and while the message that it sends is as subtle as an anvil crashing on your head, it's surprisingly powerful.

Say what you will about the hype and about the free publicity that Ledger's death has earned this film but to credit it's commercial or critical success so cynically would do both the actor and this film an injustice. At the end of the day, ""The Dark Knight"" is brilliant entertainment with some phenomenal performances.

It's no definitive masterpiece but it's damn close.",no word can quit aptli describ the dark sinuou geniu of christoph nolan the dark knight a sequel to the batman begin the film defi the industri cliché of be a shameless exploit of a franchis much ha alreadi been said about heath ledger electr perform a the dement joker and littl el can realli be said it a perform that display everi psycholog tic with sadist glee and ledger virtual unrecognis behind both the makeup and the manner imbu hi charact with terrifi insan of cours ledger is just one of the mani gem in a fine cast christian bale is predict good in the titular role but he overshadow by some other key player maggi gyllenha is good a are morgan freeman and gari oldman but it aaron eckhart who give a truli amaz perform a harvey dent gotham idealist da and the citi moral centr eckhart innocu golden boy look beli hi dramat finess and he convey the dualiti of harvey charact and ideal with great deft the high calibr of the cast is reason enough to go see the movi but it the screenplay written by the nolan brother that allow the dark knight to becom more than just an adequ sequel for all the cartoonish connot of it comic book origin the movi is a rich and fascin studi into the machin of justic and human in a genr of such formula convent where doom romanc and final showdown are automat entrench in the storylin to inspir the same old messag and emot it hard to find some new ground the dark knight succe howev in toy with these veri convent and while the messag that it send is a subtl a an anvil crash on your head it surprisingli power say what you will about the hype and about the free public that ledger death ha earn thi film but to credit it commerci or critic success so cynic would do both the actor and thi film an injustic at the end of the day the dark knight is brilliant entertain with some phenomen perform it no definit masterpiec but it damn close,Positive
"Wow. How else could I describe this movie? I was wondering how this could possibly better than Batman Begins, but the truth is it was a different type of a movie. Yet it still held those morals of righteousness, faith, ethics, responsibility and so on, it was just presented in a different way.

The acting was amazing overall. Maybe not every individual performance was first rate but as a whole the cast was among the best ever. Christian Bale, who is undoubtedly the best Batman ever and probably the best superhero ever, like in Batman Begins, provides a deep and thought provoking performance. One with authenticity, validity, purity and most of all originality. His performance is subtle yet compelling, it is not by what we as a culture would like to think of as heroic but in my thinking that is exactly what it is. Unlike every other superhero he does not have superpowers. He is an intellectual who needs to rely on his and his friends' intelligence in order to do what he does. He is not an actual ""superhero"" he is a man. A man with the audacity to do what is always right even when no one else would do so. Bale throughout is able to display the turbulent lifestyle he lives in and how at times he ""The Batman"" himself has to question his own morality.

The best performance of the movie though was not Bale's its Heath Ledger's. Like Bale he brings originality to a comic book character. It seems though that in every comic book movie the villains are never quite as unusual or scary as they should be. Ledger in this movie is able to pull off what repeatedly other actors have failed to do as comic book villains, give you that bone chilling feeling. Entirely throughout he brings intensity beyond intensity. His performance is so capturing and disturbing that he makes you laugh out of sheer horror, something that you rarely feel while watching a movie. The most frightening part about the way he portrays his character is not his freakishness, it's that his performance is not the least bit cartoonish, it is in fact very real. His performance is just beyond words.

Aaron Eckhart was quite a surprise to me. We basically saw the rise and fall of his character Harvey Dent. The way he transformed from an incorruptible district attorney to a vengeful bloodthirsty maniac was simply perfect. Gary Oldman I was not surprised by though. I have always thought of him as a talented actor and unlike Batman Begins he is able to give a more serious portrayal of James Gordon and did as well as I expected and more. Maggie Gyllenhaal was a godsend compared to Katie Holmes. She seemed more fitting in the role of a lawyer and was able to pull off many scenes Holmes probably could not. Michael Caine is perfect for the role of Alfred. Alfred is more than a butler of Batman he is a friend, a father figure and righteous man. Who better than for Michael Caine with his great voice to portray such a character? Another actor with an even better voice is Morgan Freeman. He may not have had a large amount of screen time but he was certainly never a forgotten figure at any point in this movie.

The writing was very good. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan are among the best writers currently and once again show off their talent. What is so interesting in the way that the script was written was that it did not aim to make anyone the star of the show. This script brought the best or should I say the most intriguing traits out of every character and actor. Everyone in this film had their moment to shine which was very satisfying to see. Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman all deservingly so are allowed to not just be in this movie but a part of it. Not once have I thought ""oh I wish I could have seen more of this character and less of that one"". The writing was the glue to this movie and should be given more credit.

I am now much more comfortable with saying that Christopher Nolan is currently the best director. He in the past has done great movies such as Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins and The Prestige. This movie was a perfectly crafted and is probably one of the best made movies ever. He is able to do something that most directors, including the great ones, cannot do. He can keep you well engaged into a movie and still provide some sort of a deep meaning at the same time. At no point in this movie did I ever wonder what time it was or how much longer is left. That something I could say I have never done. What other director in the past has brought out depth from a superhero? The answer is no other has. He maintains an authentic feeling that you would get from watching The Godfather and still excite you like your watching Die Hard. His direction in this movie is more than special it is a monumental achievement in film.

Now what do I mean by a sign of hope? It not only has its hopeful and inspiring message saying that we have the power. It says that society doesn't have to determine who we are. That is not even it though. Over the years now summer blockbusters have become mostly shallow and superficial. This maybe one of the biggest blockbusters ever but it has something that the others did not have: true, deep meaning. Hopefully this movie can be an example to the rest of Hollywood. Maybe just maybe Hollywood can do something that it has not done for years; incorporating thought provoking, deep philosophical themes consistently back into their summer blockbuster commercial movies.",wow how el could i describ thi movi i wa wonder how thi could possibl better than batman begin but the truth is it wa a differ type of a movi yet it still held those moral of righteous faith

"Finally, a super-hero film for adults. Avoiding the cartoon-style exploits of such super-heroes as Superman and Spiderman, director Christopher Nolan has fashioned a sophisticated, but hugely entertaining, take on the equally impressive Batman. ""The Dark Knight"" is witty, intelligent, and fast paced. The action scenes and effects are spectacular, but do not dominate or overwhelm the film. Nolan does not linger over gratuitous explosions and lengthy chases. When a scene has communicated its purpose, he wisely moves on. Despite the film's 2½ hour running time, the movie seems tight and has little excess.

Although Batman has no Robin, he is surrounded by a fine group of villains and supporters. Michael Caine underplays the quasi-butler, but delivers some amusing lines, and Morgan Freeman is solid and reassuring as another of Bruce Wayne's employees. Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman ably hold up the public servant side of the equation, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is fine as Rachel Dawes, although few demands were made on her talents. In the central role, Christian Bale is a fine Bruce Wayne/Batman. His icy-perfect face and pumped-up body are physically all that a Batman should be. Yet beneath the glossy exterior, he manages to breathe life into the crusading vigilante. Then, of course, there is the late Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger's performance steals every scene that he is in. Behind a crude childish makeup, he is at once demented, evil, funny, and over-the-top entertaining. However, even when he is delivering a humorous line, the villainous edge remains. When Ledger flicks his tongue, plays with his hands, or rolls his eyes, he captures the audience and holds them with his magic.

Future super-hero films undoubtedly will be measured against ""The Dark Knight."" From Batman's stylish costume, his motorcycle, and the Batmobile to the dark, glistening cinematography, the stylish art direction, and the state-of-the-art special effects, the film rarely falters. With a sterling cast and a gifted director, ""The Dark Knight"" sets a new standard for summer action flicks. At last, a comic-book super-hero film that will not only grab the key pre-teen male audience, but also bring in discerning adults who may never have read a comic book or attended a movie in the summer.

"I have never been a big fan of Batman. I went to see Batman Begins when it first came out and haven't seen it a second time.

I saw The Dark Knight, and I thought it was a very good movie. Because I don't know a lot about Batman, a few points were a little hard to follow. Overall, though, you wouldn't have to see the first movie in order to understand, or really have seen the cartoons or read the comics, either.

As others have stated already, Heath Ledger's performance was incredible. He's portrayal of The Joker was extremely creepy and psychotic, adding humor to his morbidity. The plot kept me guessing and wondering how it would end.

This movie was very enjoyable and I will probably see it again.",i have never been a big fan of batman i went to see batman begin when it first came out and havent seen it a second time i saw the dark knight and i thought it wa a veri good movi becaus i dont know a lot about batman a few point were a littl hard to follow overal though you wouldnt have to see the first movi in order to understand or realli have seen the cartoon or read the comic either a other have state alreadi heath ledger perform wa incred he portray of the joker wa extrem creepi and psychot ad humor to hi morbid the plot kept me guess and wonder how it would end thi movi wa veri enjoy and i will probabl see it again,Neutral
"Glad to see I'm not the only one who didn't like The Dark Knight. I can step back and objectively say it was a ""good"" movie on some levels, the performances, over-the-top entertainment, etc. But the bottom line is I hated it. Loud, obnoxious, pointless, and soulless. Who are these awful people? Heath Ledger immersed himself into the role of the Joker, and it was impressive. He's fascinating to watch. But what is the point of his character? At least Jack Nicholson was humorous in the role, Heath's joker is just a train wreck psychopath with absolutely no redeeming value. I don't get the point. Why do we find these despicable characters entertaining, are we that desperate?

I was disappointed in Christian Bale too. He is one of the best actors working today, but this time he was kind of flat. I thought he was better in Batman Begins. This entire movie is just so over-the-top: explosions (wow an explosion, that's new), the cool looking but ridiculous motor-cycle, the millionth chase scene, repulsive characters like Two-Face, and on and on. We've seen it all so movie makers have to go to extreme lengths to entertain us jaded moviegoers, and this loud, obnoxious trash is the result. We really are getting desperate.

I usually agree with IMDb more or less, the ratings are usually reliable. But right now this is #5, come on could we please settle down on the hyperbole with this movie? I'm not hating it on purpose because of the hype, I liked Iron Man and that got hyped, I liked the Wrestler and that got hyped. But this nightmare of a movie needs a backlash.",glad to see im not the onli one who didnt like the dark knight i can step back and object say it wa a good movi on some level the perform overthetop entertain etc but the bottom line is i hate it loud obnoxi pointless and soulless who are these aw peopl heath ledger immers himself into the role of the joker and it wa impress he fascin to watch but what is the point of hi charact at least jack nicholson wa humor in the role heath joker is just a train wreck psychopath with absolut no redeem valu i dont get the point whi do we find these despic charact entertain are we that desper i wa disappoint in christian bale too he is one of the best actor work today but thi time he wa kind of flat i thought he wa better in batman begin thi entir movi is just so overthetop explos wow an explos that new the cool look but ridicul motorcycl the millionth chase scene repuls charact like twofac and on and on weve seen it all so movi maker have to go to extrem length to entertain u jade moviego and thi loud obnoxi trash is the result we realli are get desper i usual agre with imdb more or less the rate are usual reliabl but right now thi is come on could we plea settl down on the hyperbol with thi movi im not hate it on purpos becaus of the hype i like iron man and that got hype i like the wrestler and that got hype but thi nightmar of a movi need a backlash,Negative
"Bravo! finally, this truly was a quality film, the acting, directing and writing, this film is like something you've never seen from a superhero / comic book adaptation films.

Let me start with the acting, Heath ledger... everything has already been said about this performance, yet he still managed to surprise me, what a performance, hat's off, he really does get under your skin, created (togather with writers of course) the perfect joker, or at least the one i wanted to see, dark, psychotic and a maniac. Aaron Arkhat (or however you spell his name) also gave a strong performance as Hearvy Dent, and the other cast was pretty solid.

The script is just great... this is truly one of the best films if not the best that portrait the battle between good and evil, between what right and wrong, and about making the right choices.

Now, retrospectively, i am really disappointed with the trailers for this movie, they composed different sentences to give it a more intense feeling and gave a lot of the action in the movie... sure they were great, but also gives you high expectations for this movie... and i hate coming to a movie with high expectations, so a little let down in that aspect. and yes 2 hours and a half did feel a bit long.

That been said, TDK is a fantastic movie (sure it has some flaws, but what movie doesn't) its well written, directed and acted, action packed and even epic in a way only time will make it.

Overall this is a MUST SEE movie for anyone that has a little sympathy for movies.

"The opening sequence (which most people have seen online due to the footage being shown on some trailer reels) sets the stage for the entire film. An eerie score, brilliant directing, and spot on acting. There isn't too much that I feel comfortable saying about this film that hasn't already been said a thousand times, and wouldn't give anything away. I will tell you that The Joker is incredible.

"This is my big question as of late when reading the rave reviews for this super-overrated trash heap. When people start comparing this to REAL masterpieces like ""Lord of the Rings"", thats where i have to draw the line. i mean seriously what the hell is wrong with these people. thankfully I'm not alone in feeling this way. and its a shame because I've been a batman fan all my life, ever since i first saw the brilliant 1989 Batman with Keaton and nicholson, 2 of my favorite actors. the film was and is magical. it defined what a Comic Book movie should be. i saw and loved all of the subsequent sequels, except the 4th film, obviously. and yes i love Adam wests hilarious portrayal as well. but even that 4th camp entry with Ahnuld was more watchable then these new ones. yes, i will take my bat credit card (exp date: Forever) right to the bank before i will watch TDK again. now its sad because i cant say im a batman fan without having to explain to people why i cant stand the new movies. i constantly have to say ""oh i love the batman movies, the ORIGINAL movies, but not the new ones"". its gets tiring. on top of all this, the fans/nerds of these films have created almost a cult like following who seem to literally worship nolan and his *lack of* vision. hes no tim burton. he doesn't have the style OR substance. i saw Batman Begins and thought it was just OK, but disappointing. i saw TDK back when it first came out. i, like most everyone else, was bought by the hype. but after seeing it twice, i came to the conclusion that most fans will not agree with: THIS IS NOT A BATMAN FILM. call it a crime drama. call it a Heat remake, but please don't have the nerve to call it a batman film, because its just not. more then that, its completely humorless and with not even a hint of comedy, unless you count the really stupid cop lines ""i didn't sign up for this!"" JEEEZ. thats bad. actually it was the lines that were unintentionally bad like ""NO MO DEAD COPZ!"". *rolles eye*.

But what gets me is those that review this movie that its a great comic book adaptation. couldn't be further from the truth. a superhero movie to be good, has to actually at least somewhat resemble the comics. nolan looks to completely set his movies apart from the other ones that he completely misses the point and the fun of batman. ""i will make my batman feel smart and intellectual"". however all he does is make very long, boring, drab, serious movies that never acknowledge the fact that its about a man dressed in a halloween costume. thats what upset me more then anything else. it doesn't even have the word ""batman"" in the title! i think the director was playing it safe to an extent in the first one, which did at times feel more like a batman film, whereas this one felt like little more then an elongated episode of ""law and order"". look, i know CSI is popular on TV these days, but it doesn't belong in a batman film. when i think of batman, i think, BIG action, COOL batmobile, wacky, colorful villains and big bombastic musical score. BIG. every things gotta be big. thats what you got with the original films. this movie however is like batman on a budget. i could get this same lame average car chases from an episode of 24. but in a batman movie, every things supposed to be a heightened reality and more fantastical and like a comic book. pure escapism. but no, not this version. this is what I've come to call the ""dull"" batman. nothing about nolan's vision excites me, from the modern-day urban-grit makeover, to the facile 24 style anti-terrorist plots, to the uninspired flatly staged action scenes. according to most bat fans, nolan's is the best comic-book adaptation of all time, yet I can find nothing in these movies that is fascinated by its comic book sources and the films simply read to me as an uninspired extension of the modern ""realistic gritty"" action movie although it suffers by comparison from a lack of earnestness or gleefulness. not only is the direction all wrong, but its got NO good action scenes. what little action there is, is completely dull. batman rides that fugly tank thing to chase joker. he goes to hong Kong. nice. then he uses everyones cell phones (more stupid cell phone propaganda) to locate joker and then proceeds to get the crap beat out of him BY joker. then he rescues him! HAHA. the movie is so stupid. joker never got the beating he wholly deserved. the message of the film is disgusting and depressing, if you can even figure it out amidst all the constant psychobabble thats thrown around. two face was a write-off, reduced to a cameo, a footnote for what is usually a very cool villain. tommy lee Jones may have been a bit hammy, but he was damn entertaining! this version, like the film itself, is instantly forgettable. why is it taking everyone so long to take off the emperors new clothes? this movie is abysmal and the fact so many people enjoy it so much says something gravely disturbing about society. i think people need to wake up, go to church, rekindle there soul and get away from this overly serious mumbo jumbo. why so serious is right, only i want to ask the director that. these movies only inspire death and killings. you never heard this happening with the original batman movies. now look. pretty scary. but im sure this will only inspire holly-weird to make even MORE of these dark depressing soulless hype machines that will only inspire more killings and so on and so on.",thi is my big question a of late when read the rave review for

"The sheer brilliance of this film cannot be described in words. The Nolan brothers have delivered one of the most riveting and powerful scripts in recent times with lot of technical panache'. This is a film that never lets go of its momentum right from the beginning and holds your attention till the most morally complex climax in a summer movie.

Do not treat this film as a superhero or a vigilante story. It has lot more going for it. For instance one of the many ""Aces"" in the movie is the Joker - heath ledger. He owns every scene that he is in and it was good to see the rest of cast let him grab the center stage whenever he is on screen. The actor has set a tough benchmark with this role and he will be remembered for years to come.

""The Dark Knight"" is as much a showcase of action set pieces as it is a classic story between good and evil and what happens when lines are crossed on both the sides to achieve their respective motives.

Batman is a hero not because of the stunts that he performs or the fights he engages himself in but because the sacrifices he makes for the city he believes in. This is beautifully depicted in this movie and we feel for him when the movie reaches its pinnacle.

There are lots of positives one can see within this 2 hour plus epic.

In simple words. It is a 10 on 10 and must see.",the sheer brillianc of thi film cannot be describ in word the nolan brother have deliv one of the most rivet and power script in recent time with lot of technic panach thi is a film that never let go of it momentum right from the begin and hold your attent till the most moral complex climax in a summer movi do not treat thi film a a superhero or a vigilant stori it ha lot more go for it for instanc one of the mani ace in the movi is the joker heath ledger he own everi scene that he is in and it wa good to see the rest of cast let him grab the center stage whenev he is on screen the actor ha set a tough benchmark with thi role and he will be rememb for year to come the dark knight is a much a showcas of action set piec a it is a classic stori between good and evil and what happen when line are cross on both the side to achiev their respect motiv batman is a hero not becaus of the stunt that he perform or the fight he engag himself in but becaus the sacrific he make for the citi he believ in thi is beauti depict in thi movi and we feel for him when the movi reach it pinnacl there are lot of posit one can see within thi hour plu epic in simpl word it is a on and must see,Positive
"Before ""The Dark Knight"" was released, I mulled over the uniqueness of Titanic's success. Perhaps not worldwide, but in the United States, Titanic's success was certainly unprecedented. Back to ""The Dark Knight"". Growing up, there had only been one movie that had enveloped almost every possible area of media before its release; ""Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"". Rightfully so, because Star Wars was and still is the highest grossing trilogy in U.S. history. Until recently, that had been the most ""hyped"" film I have been alive to see open in the theaters. That was of course until ""The Dark Knight"".

I remember my friends buying tickets 2 weeks in advance for the IMAX screening of ""I Am Legend"" in December, just so we could get the 6 minute sneak of ""The Dark Knight"". When the sneak of ""The Dark Knight"" was over, it was met with uproarious applause. Right then I knew this film was going to be special. And then came the unfortunate passing of Heath Ledger. But instead of deterring those to see the movie, the buzz surrounding his take on ""The Joker"" began to spread like the plague. And as the time approached for the film's release, words and phrases like ""Masterpiece"", ""Oscar-Worthy"", and ""Best of its genre"" began showing up in various media outlets. The controversy of Ledger's death, matched with this buzz of his performance, matched with the media dubbing this film ""Not to be missed"" made this the most anticipated film release in my lifetime. Much more so than any of the 3 Star Wars prequels.

In closing, for those of you who haven't seen the film... In fact for those of you who haven't seen any Batman films... This film certainly lived up to its hype. Chris Nolan pushed the envelope for what is considered a ""comic book movie"", because unlike 99.9% of comic book films, when watching ""The Dark Knight"", everything in the movie is most certainly possible in the real world (perhaps even the bat-pod). So the movie plays off as more of a Crime-Action/Drama than it does a stereotypical Comic book flick. At the rate this film is going, it will at the least become the second highest-grossing film in U.S. history, and at the most, it will soar over Titanic.",befor the dark knight wa releas i mull over the uniqu of titan success perhap not worldwid but in the unit state titan success wa certainli unpreced back to the dark knight grow up there had onli been one movi that had envelop almost everi possibl area of medium befor it releas star war episod the phantom menac right so becaus star war wa and still is the highest gross trilog in u histori until recent that had been the most hype film i have been aliv to see open in the theater that wa of cours until the dark knight i rememb my friend buy ticket week in advanc for the imax screen of i am legend in decemb just so we could get the minut sneak of the dark knight when the sneak of the dark knight wa over it wa met with uproari applaus right then i knew thi film wa go to be special and then came the unfortun pas of heath ledger but instead of deter those to see the movi the buzz surround hi take on the joker began to spread like the plagu and a the time approach for the film releas word and phrase like masterpiec oscarworthi and best of it genr began show up in variou medium outlet the controversi of ledger death match with thi buzz of hi perform match with the medium dub thi film not to be miss made thi the most anticip film releas in my lifetim much more so than ani of the star war prequel in close for those of you who havent seen the film in fact for those of you who havent seen ani batman film thi film certainli live up to it hype chri nolan push the envelop for what is consid a comic book movi becaus unlik of comic book film when watch the dark knight everyth in the movi is most certainli possibl in the real world perhap even the batpod so the movi play off a more of a crimeactiondrama than it doe a stereotyp comic book flick at the rate thi film is go it will at the least becom the second highestgross film in u histori and at the most it will soar over titan,Neutral
"Now don't get me wrong, I did like this movie. but really? Why does everyone think this is the most amazing superhero movie of all time? the movie dragged on for far too long and really wasn't as entertaining as movies like Spider-Man 2, Iron Man, or even the Tim Burton Batman films. In my mind, this movie doesn't hold a candle to those movies. the general plot was boring and way too serious, Bale's acting was horrible (He was much better in Batman Begins), and there was way too much dialogue. On the other hand, Ledger was amazing as the Joker, and the overall acting from the rest of the cast was good (With the exception of Bale and Aaron Eckhart. they were pretty bad in this one.) The action was great, although, at some points in the movie, I felt like I've seen it all before. over all, the movie was good, and I would've even considered it a classic at one point. but the overall hype of this movie seems to extinguish that notion from my mind. as I said before, it's a good movie, but not as amazing as people put it out to be.",now dont get me wrong i did like thi movi but realli whi doe everyon think thi is the most amaz superhero movi of all time the movi drag on for far too long and realli wasnt a entertain a movi like spiderman iron man or even the tim burton batman film in my mind thi movi doesnt hold a candl to those movi the gener plot wa bore and way too seriou bale act wa horribl he wa much better in batman begin and there wa way too much dialogu on the other hand ledger wa amaz a the joker and the overal act from the rest of the cast wa good with the except of bale and aaron eckhart they were pretti bad in thi one the action wa great although at some point in the movi i felt like ive seen it all befor over all the movi wa good and i wouldv even consid it a classic at one point but the overal hype of thi movi seem to extinguish that notion from my mind a i said befor it a good movi but not a amaz a peopl put it out to be,Neutral
"The simpler it was the better it became.

The movie just showed me what I need to do in oder to become like him. That's how great the movie was. A real detective story minus the character's cape and horns. The movie's complex plot was a product good understanding of a simple story.

I like the way Bruce Wayne was portrayed, a renewed man pretending to be a spoiled brat. This is just a good way to hide his true identity, by being what people expect him to be. Like the Art of War, when you are strong you pretend that you are weak. A true player of the system so he can continue with his work.

The Joker in this movie is just great evidence of great acting. When you begin to see the character and not the actor, you begin to understand that Heath did a great job on the Joker. I remember the Joker not Heath.

The movie's theme and music became my last-song-syndrome, great score by Hans Zimmer. The theme was really thought off and studied well, understood the need of the story.

"It's hard to say that the Dark Knight is a bad movie. After all, it's well acted, well directed, and deals with some heavyweight, complex social and ethical issues.

Problem is... is that what you really wanted to see? A drama? A deadpan, straight-faced, humourless, mostly action-free drama?

I like dramas... I really do. Some of my favourite movies fall under the drama umbrella - Shawshank, Shine, Goodwill Hunting, Once were warriors, American History X, The Assassination of Jesse James, Ondskan...

But lets be honest with ourselves shall we? We're sitting in the theatre watching a movie about a billionaire vigilante in a caped bat costume fighting a green-haired clown. How much drama/realism can you truly inject into that mix before you lose any and all sense of good entertainment?

Sadly, not this much. And I'm at a complete loss as to how this movie got such a high IMDb rating (9.4 at the time of writing). The only thing I can speculate is that an entire new generation of over-enthusiastic, and apparently very easily-pleased, youngsters just reached movie-going age and skewed the results.

"Batman. Pause and think about that character for a minute. ""The Batman"" is a guy in a spandex bat suit going around fighting crime, a superhero character from a comic book from the 1940's for young children looking for a bit of fun and a place for their juvenile imaginations to run free. His sworn enemy is ""the Joker"", a clown with clown tricks up his sleeve who's a villain.

Where the earlier Tim Burton adaptations were fun and tongue in cheek, this here takes the Batman, the guy running around in spandex in a bat suit fighting off the bad guys... and makes an attempt at a disconcertingly, utterly serious film noir with an atmosphere about as dense as a horror movie, exceeding the 2hr30 mark. It's... like a joke, it's something akin to the concept for a comedy sketch one would have. To take something a bit ridiculous and light, and reverse its momentum in making it into this piece that takes itself completely, utterly seriously. It's a very common premise for many comedy sketches or concepts.

The fact it was received so absurdly well by the greater public is, sadly, testament to how empty and strayed our current times are, that the common individual looks for a hero and ideals of greatness, epic drama, and meaning, in something like a 3 hour long horror movie/thriller version of Batman directed by Christopher Nolan. And this review doesn't even take into account the film from a technical perspective: too many characters, cringy silly scenes, way too long... etc",batman paus and think about that charact for a minut the batman is a guy in a spandex bat suit go around fight crime a superhero charact from a comic book from the s for young child look for a bit of fun and a place for their juvenil imagin to run free hi sworn enemi is the joker a clown with clown trick up hi sleev who a villain where the earlier tim burton adapt were fun and tongu in cheek thi here take the batman the guy run around in spandex in a bat suit fight off the bad guy and make an attempt at a disconcertingli utterli seriou film noir with an atmospher about a den a a horror movi exceed the hr mark it like a joke it someth akin to the concept for a comedi sketch one would have to take someth a bit ridicul and light and revers it momentum in make it into thi piec that take itself complet utterli serious it a veri common premis for mani comedi sketch or concept the fact it wa receiv so absurdli well by the greater public is sadli testament to how empti and stray our current time are that the common individu look for a hero and ideal of great epic drama and mean in someth like a hour long horror moviethril version of batman direct by christoph nolan and thi review doesnt even take into account the film from a technic perspect too mani charact cringi silli scene way too long etc,Positive
"I was just afforded the opportunity to watch the newest batman installment The Dark Knight but not only did i get to lay my eyes upon a Nolan gift to the world, I saw it at 12.00pm and school was back in session.

So without the constant ramblings of minors or the reverberating sounds of popcorn crunching I was allowed to fully appreciate what had been put to the screen.

To say i was elated with the finished result is an enormous understatement but it is also something that does not come on like a flood. Some scenes once begun can seem like a simply and brainless action flick as ""spiderman"" is asked to chose someone's fate but the conclusion of each scene leaves you stunned as if you have just come to the twist in fight club and no one has spoiled the ending.

It does not take much thought to see that this is a good film, but soon after the movie whilst you are sipping on your Mocha or catching the train home as I did, that you realise this is a great film. Morals are questioned and lines are crossed and these are all beautifully created by the Nolan brothers.

They may not have the odd brilliance of the Coens or the VFX beauty of the Wachowski's but this brother duo are the new force to be reckoned with in theatre. The title says crime film and I stand by that notion because what the Nolan's put to screen is not a comic-book PG blockbuster. Within minutes you feel like you are watching another crime thriller even though the protagonist is dressed in a black Kevlar suit and the antagonist dolled up like a two-dollar hooker.

The action/story is fast-paced and the editing very edgy throughout fight scenes keeping that sense that we are all just blind as bats as he moves amongst us.

And now onto the performances, Without doubt one of Ledger best characters and I know that the former statement is already echoing like a poor cliché but it can be justified. It was not so much as what he said in the movie that evoked my 'endearment' but what he left to his body. His jerky movements and twitches as he almost seems uncomfortable in the trappings of his human body and then when he does open his mouth it amplifies everything that his body tells you. It is so easy to forget that this is in fact Heath Ledger, the man who sang to Julia Stiles in 10 Things I Hate About You, he simply is not himself and you can feel just how much he put into his performance because you truly believe that this man is mad.

It goes unsaid that Morgan Freeman and Michael Cain both dominate in their particular roles especially in the case of Cain as he is given some wonderful dialog, which he delivers with perfect tone absolutely stealing the scene from anyone he is accompanying.

Bale again shows the world what a real batman should be; torn, misguided, hopeful and terrifying but the one role that truly stood out in the film was that of Gary Oldman. Long gone is the sympathetic innocence we saw of his character in Batman Begins, as he gives rise to a powerful Gordon and a character that really belongs in Nolan's envisioning of Gotham. As i watched each scene with Oldman I thought that i was watching the likes of Keitel or Spacey, he took every opportunity to prove himself as a great actor and in each scene he intimidates the audience with his power.

The main factor behind the re-birth of the Batman franchise is believability, Gone are the glo-paint and mo-hawks as the Nolan's give a haunting image of a world, our world, riddled with corruption in it's darkest hours before the dawn.

"I am a batman fan. Not a fanboy mind you, I have read the comics, seen the other films, and like batman story well enough, but unlike a few of my friends, I haven't been following the release for this movie like a bloodhound. But thanks to above mentioned friends, I have been passively looking forward to it. So we booked our tickets, got to one of the first showings in the world (I live in Australia) and got ready to see a movie that could not possibly live up to the hype that has engulfed the world. I was so wrong, so, so wrong.

This film stands so far above its predecessor it is on another planet. Nolans script is, like most of his movies, a complex and involving one. Unlike his some of his other films, the acting, story, cinematography etc all belong on the same pedestal. Never before have I felt the palm sweaty excitement of a gripping film take hold of me for a complete running time (and keep in mind this is 2 and half hours). The lack of CGI is one of the films biggest assets. The action feels gritty and real, involving you more than the graphics heavy iron man or Hulk ever did.

Id heard talk of Ledger being nominated for a posthumous Oscar but had thought it a silly move, why give awards to someone who cannot accept it? But his performance is mind blowing, creating one of the best villains ever to grace the screen. I don't know if an Oscar is the right way to do it, but his performance needs to be acknowledged for the masterpiece it is. Id heard a critic call this the ""empire strikes back"" of superhero films, and it really is the perfect comparison. This film proves that some ""superhero"" movies don't belong in a little niche, to be weighed against each other, not the ""serious"" films, but can instead be acclaimed as deep, involving and above all exciting works of film-making.",i am a batman fan not a fanboy mind you i have read the comic seen the other film and like batman stori well enough but unlik a few of my friend i havent been follow the releas for thi movi like a bloodhound but thank to abov mention friend i have been passiv look forward to it so we book our ticket got to one of the first show in the world i live in australia and got readi to see a movi that could not possibl live up to the hype that ha engulf the world i wa so wrong so so wrong thi film stand so far abov it predecessor it is on anoth planet nolan script is like most of hi movi a complex and involv one unlik hi some of hi other film the act stori cinematographi etc all belong on the same pedest never befor have i felt the palm sweati excit of a grip film take hold of me for a complet run time and keep in mind thi is and half hour the lack of cgi is one of the film biggest asset the action feel gritti and real involv you more than the graphic heavi iron man or hulk ever did id heard talk of ledger be nomin for a posthum oscar but had thought it a silli move whi give award to someon who cannot accept it but hi perform is mind blow creat one of the best villain ever to grace the screen i dont know if an oscar is the right way to do it but hi perform need to be acknowledg for the masterpiec it is id heard a critic call thi the empir strike back of superhero film and it realli is the perfect comparison thi film prove that some superhero movi dont belong in a littl nich to be weigh against each other not the seriou film but can instead be acclaim a deep involv and abov all excit work of filmmak,Positive
"Let's get this out of the way right off the top: Heath Ledger is nothing short of amazing in this film. ** Heath Ledger's Joker makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look like Cesar Romero's Joker. ** Less cartoony and far more menacing, this Joker actually feels dangerous. Every moment he's on screen your eyes are simply glued there, just soaking in this iconic performance. His look, his mannerisms, his voice... they all come together to make the perfect Joker, and probably the best villain ever seen on screen in a superhero movie... or any movie, for that matter. It's really quite a shame Ledger passed away, as I would love to have seen him portray that character again and again.

Does the rest of the movie match this level of excellence? Well, not entirely... It's got plenty of action, just enough humor, and a good script for the most part, but there are a couple minor things that bothered me slightly:

If they have to recast Rachel Dawes, fine, but Maggie Gyllenhal is a big step down; Bale's gruff ""Batman"" voice still sounds a little over-the-top and almost humorous at times; and the movie takes a few unnecessary turns, especially towards the end. Much off this is due to the involvement of ""Two-Face."" This film didn't need a second villain. His time on screen does nothing but make the audience wish they'd hurry up and get back to the REAL villain. I've never cared for the character, and I suppose it's good they didn't wait to try to use him as the sole foe in a future film, but he simply didn't do anything for me. Aside from those aspects, however, it's difficult to find much to criticize in this movie.

I struggled greatly with the rating for this one, as without The Joker, the rest would only have made for another above-average film like Batman Begins. But Ledger's Joker is undeniably the star of this show, and based on that performance alone, I spot it the higher rating. Forget The Dark Knight - they should just call this The Joker. Ledger simply OWNS this film.",let get thi out of the way right off the top heath ledger is noth short of amaz in thi film heath ledger joker make jack nicholson joker look like cesar romero joker less cartooni and far more menac thi joker actual feel danger everi moment he on screen your eye are simpli glu there just soak in thi icon perform hi look hi manner hi voic they all come togeth to make the perfect joker and probabl the best villain ever seen on screen in a superhero movi or ani movi for that matter it realli quit a shame ledger pas away a i would love to have seen him portray that charact again and again doe the rest of the movi match thi level of excel well not entir it got plenti of action just enough humor and a good script for the most part but there are a coupl minor thing that bother me slightli if they have to recast rachel daw fine but maggi gyllenh is a big step down bale gruff batman voic still sound a littl overthetop and almost humor at time and the movi take a few unnecessari turn especi toward the end much off thi is due to the involv of twofac thi film didnt need a second villain hi time on screen doe noth but make the audienc wish theyd hurri up and get back to the real villain ive never care for the charact and i suppos it good they didnt wait to tri to use him a the sole foe in a futur film but he simpli didnt do anyth for me asid from those aspect howev it difficult to find much to critic in thi movi i struggl greatli with the rate for thi one a without the joker the rest would onli have made for anoth aboveaverag film like batman begin but ledger joker is undeni the star of thi show and base on that perform alon i spot it the higher rate forget the dark knight they should just call thi the joker ledger simpli own thi film,Neutral
"Actually, first of all, I can't compare Batman Begins with the Dark Knight. They have different plot. Begins shows the introduction of Batman, the origin of Batman. The Dark Knight has a more darker plus interesting plot. It is commendable. Plus bigger action pieces, the movie goes in deep with humans' feelings. It is quite good and I understand it receives a lot of positive reviews. Christopher Nolan did a good job in everything in the movie, making the story deep and dark but engrossing.

The story: The Joker is trying to destroy Gotham and wants to kill Batman at first. With his trick plans, nobody even Batman can find him or predict his next move. Batman must stop the Joker from further destruction of Gotham. From there, humans' emotions slowly rise. There are some big action pieces, plot that you want to know and electronic music. I am somewhat disappointed with Two-face aka Harvey Dent, considered the white knight. I wished that Two-face will be given a bigger role. Other from that, it is hard to see any faults with the movie. Acting is good, Heath ledger makes a good joker.

Overall: It is good to watch this in cinema. The runtime although long seems to pass quickly. You won't be disappointed. The first scene features bank robbing to hype the audience. It, not only shows you that it has the big action, shows the bad and good of a human which is one of the thing in the movie.",actual first of all i cant compar batman begin with the dark knight they have differ plot begin show the introduct of batman the origin of batman the dark knight ha a more darker plu interest plot it is commend plu bigger action piec the movi goe in deep with human feel it is quit good and i understand it receiv a lot of posit review christoph nolan did a good job in everyth in the movi make the stori deep and dark but engross the stori the joker is tri to destroy gotham and want to kill batman at first with hi trick plan nobodi even batman can find him or predict hi next move batman must stop the joker from further destruct of gotham from there human emot slowli rise there are some big action piec plot that you want to know and electron music i am somewhat disappoint with twofac aka harvey dent consid the white knight i wish that twofac will be given a bigger role other from that it is hard to see ani fault with the movi act is good heath ledger make a good joker overal it is good to watch thi in cinema the runtim although long seem to pas quickli you wont be disappoint the first scene featur bank rob to hype the audienc it not onli show you that it ha the big action show the bad and good of a human which is one of the thing in the movi,Positive
"To tell you the truth, I was not a fan of Batman and I really don't like comics. I saw The Dark Knight because my boyfriend wanted to see it. And I'm glad to tell all the world around me - The Dark Knight is super, great and the unique one. I think it's not necessary to comment Heath Ledger and his role. In my opinion the main character in this movie is not Batman but The Joker. Ledger gave life to his crazy character.

"Saw it at a preview last night and thus did not have the benefit of reviews beforehand. Although I let most of my kids watch ""Batman Begins"", I won't let anyone but the teenagers see this one. I thought the movie was exceptional, but the menace of The Joker is too intense for kids younger than that. I'm not suggesting they'll be scarred for life, but don't let the action figures and kids' meals fool you - this movie feels real and it's one of the darkest I've seen in a long time. If you've read the Batman graphic novels of the modern era then you know what to expect, but people unfamiliar with how low Batman can go may be in for a shock (my wife was one!).

"When I walked out of the movie I was asked what I liked about it. ""Everything,"" I answered. Everything was nearly perfect about this movie: the action scenes were intense; the plot was easy to follow to enjoy the movie, but deep enough that it merits a small discussion with a group or multiple viewings; and the acting... my god, the acting was incredible. I found myself laughing out loud, not because the movie was particularly funny, but because Heath Ledger NAILED his performance in every scene.

The Joker's character nuances were hard to miss and easy to love. After his first and second appearances in the movie I found myself just waiting for the next scene with The Joker. I've seen the movie twice now and can't wait to see it again just to see Ledger's acting.

It's not that the other characters didn't do their part, because they did. As always Christian Bale delivered a performance that is hard to rival. Aaron Eckhart, I feel, has thrown himself into a realm where those who see this movie will be hard-pressed to forget him. I've always liked Eckhart, and now when I talk about him others will know who I'm talking about.

The only complaint I had is that the movie felt compact. Yes, it was long; no, it wasn't rushed. I just felt like there was so much more story to be had. It's like when you're reading a really good book and you see the number of pages narrowing and you just don't want it to end.

"My wife and myself, parents of three little kids, rarely get to go to the cinema. Two weeks ago, during our holidays, we got my parent to babysit the little monsters, so that we can finally get out again. Taking a peek into the papers (actually *real* papers, I had no internet access :-) ) revealed, that ""The Dark Knight"" was the only watchable movie playing in the small nearby town.

Somewhat reluctantly, we decided to give it a try. What the hell, we thought, we are on holidays anyway, why not check a kids movie (sorry to all fans of previous Batman movies, but that's just what I think of them).

BOY, were we surprised! After the movie, it took us a few minutes before we both burst out ""this is one of the best movies I ever saw!"" I won't go into any details, for the multitude of excellent comments on this board already presents this movie as it is: a MASTERPIECE! Especially the performance of the late Heath Ledger (Joker) was unbelievable (posthumous Oscar, anyone?) I actually felt quite nervous and actually even a bit scared during some Joker scenes - something I didn't experience that often in a movie theater! And yet, we both felt, that quite a few lines of his could have been from us... :-)

"Watching the various Batman incarnations over the years, from the Adam West era, through the Superfriends, Tim Burton and Friends, and the very excellent Bruce Timm Batman: The Animated Series of the 1990s, we are faced with various versions of the Joker.

The Animated Series Joker was voiced by Mark Hamill, and is considered by many fans to be the best Joker up to now. He certainly is creepy, and in the film spin-offs he does actually murder people explicitly on occasion, but though he is good it's hard to imagine him existing outside of the art deco alternate universe of Bruce Timm. He's just not unpredictable enough. He has steady henchmen who trust him enough to turn their backs on him.

Jack Nicholson's Joker was well-received at the time, but he too suffered from a believability gap, in addition to being over the top and, while crazy, not quite creepy.

Enter the Dark Knight's Heath Ledger: the freak make-up, the crazy, but disturbingly lucid philosophy, the complete lack of empathy for other people, and the scary practice of killing people for fun and without warning, his fondness for knives. I can actually imagine running into a character like this in a city somewhere. Certainly, not quite as complete, the real-life version wouldn't have the smarts to pull off so many grand schemes along with all the pure evil traits (you hope), but there are a small number of people out there who share some of the Joker's characteristics, and that's what makes Ledger's character so creepy, so scary.

Every scene he is in, accompanied by music that would feel at home in any Hitchcock or horror film, is filled with a sense of tension and dread. What horror will he next bring upon the people standing before him? Who's next? Without a doubt the best Joker ever, Ledger's performance did not feel at all like a comic book superhero movie bad guy. I was thinking more like Hannibal Lechtur. Intelligent, lucid, menacing, and, I'm convinced, not really insane, but horribly sane, with a tendency to view life as pointless and thus amusing.

Oh, yeah, the rest of the movie? That was good, too. Eckhart's Harvey Dent was also very satisfying, with no campiness to bring it down. His trajectory from ace prosecutor to criminal Two-Face is very well-done. Bale, Caine, Oldman, Freeman, and Gyllenhall are all well-cast. The action is better than Batman Begins, with the fistfight scenes in particular being easier on the eyes, with less spastic camera motion. The writing and direction is more along the lines of a crime drama or an action film than a comic book adaptation, and the story starts off with action and keeps you going for the whole 2.5 hours.

"I thought I would be disappointed after all the hype that surrounded the movie but I was glad that I was wrong. This movie rocks and by far the best movie in 2008. And I thought that Batman Begins was difficult to top! Heath Ledger gave the performance of his life. You really have to give credit to the man; he did came a long way from A Knight's Tale and 10 Things. His Joker was discomfiting, psychotic and confirms my suspicions about clowns! With his passing, it up the spooky scale a few notches. He held his own against the big wigs - well, I think he even surpassed a few of them. He has the best one-liners too! His lines spoke of chaos, death or the lack thereof. Art imitating life or vice versa. One wonders if he took his character a tad too far.

To sum it all up, The Dark Knight has twists at every turn, exciting batmobile chases, cool new gadgets (and suit!), stellar performances, tight plots and witty script. This made for a very good summer movie.

Go watch it or you'll be the last not to.

"This is for those of you who are avid film watchers and take it very seriously. Others will only applaud this film as a wonderful work. Avid film watchers will gush.

Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'--well, frankly it tickled the bottom of my cockles. I'm very rarely tickled in that magically hidden place of pleasure (save for many random moments from my fiancé). After watching this film, I can't sum up my feelings for it in one review. I must see it again, and again. I wanted to see it right after I got done watching it, but all showings were sold out at the theater I was at.

This movie will kick you in the teeth, figuratively speaking. If in an IMAX theater though, it will at least rattle your teeth as it is booming in those theaters.

The acting is superb throughout. The directing, the lighting, the action, the set pieces, the script and plot are great as well. Ledger may be getting his just rewards for his portrayal of the Joker, but I feel the other actors are getting short-shrifted in their praise. They all do very well. Even the swat team members who really have no names in the movie.

As for critics and their assertions about the movie? Too dark, too grim and depressing? No, not at all. In fact, it surprised me how far it didn't go in that direction. The graphic novels are a lot more depressing from time to time. A work of art? A masterpiece? Oscar worthy material? Yes. Yes to all three questions. More importantly though, this film is masterfully made work of love. Love for the source material. Love for film, and most importantly love for the human being.

We can be soulless creatures every now and then. We can. When the chips are down, however, we show who we really are. Not schemers, not killers. We're human.

"Admittedly everybody walks out of a cinema, and the endorphins in your brain will be telling you 'That was the coolest flipping movie I ever saw!'The Dark Knight is simply a masterpiece. It builds itself up so many times, only to turn around and take you in another direction. Heath Ledger's much hyped performance lived up to all expectations, being both chilling, yet horrifyingly captivating. Where I live in Australia was lucky enough to be one of the first showings in the world, and I feel that many of the patrons in our cinema were there solely to see our lost son in his final performance, and it is a great lasting memory for us to be left with. The only minor qualm that I may have with this film is that the final cut is more about Heath Ledger than it is about the film's star. Christian Bale had noticeably less screen time than Ledger, why this is, I am not sure. The performance of the cast is, as you would expect from the stunning ensemble cast is remarkable.

"First things first.

This film is not a comic book movie. It is not an action movie. To reduce it to these archetypes would be completely unfair.

To fairly represent this movie it must be seen for what it is - It is a dramatic suspense film that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the surprisingly long running time (surprising in that it goes by so fast, and also that the studio allowed Christoper Nolan to cut it this long) Batman Begins was seen by most to be a triumph in the comic adaptation genre. However, it did remain a comic adaptation in many ways.

The Dark Knight goes beyond that. This film blows suspense up to a city-wide level, and raises the stakes to a breathtaking level. It recalls the suspenseful nature of films by the likes of David Fincher, Ridley Scott, and even the master, Alfred Hitchcock.

It's crafted in such a way that each action seems both inevitable and unbelievable, and so even for fans of the comic book who believe they know where it is going, it is an astounding achievement.

The film looks spectacular, thanks to Nolan's regular cinematographer Wally Pfister. Gotham city looks brighter, yet more ominous during the day, and danker and more dangerous at night.

The performances are as spectacular as many had expected and/or hoped. Bale returns in fine form as the titular character, and can't be faulted too much. Eckhart debuts as District Attorney Harvey Dent, and the storyline effectively revolves around him and his war on organised crime in Gotham. There are fine supporting performances from the returning Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, as well as the newcomers Eric Roberts, Nestor Carbonell and Maggie Gyllenhaal (who thankfully takes over from Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's childhood friend Rachel Dawes).

However, if the action centres on Harvey Dent, then the action IS Heath Ledger's performance as the maniacal Joker. In one of the finest film performances of the last decade, Ledger puts in what will end up being an unforgettable final (complete) performance that will have almost everyone buzzing about a potential posthumous Academy Award.

I cannot reiterate enough - Not only is this film excellent, and highly enjoyable to watch, but it is of such a fine quality that it should really transcend the typical box created for films that are deemed to not contain the correct ""subject matter"". Much in the way Rocky transcended the typical ""sports movie"", so this transcends the typical ""comic book movie"" - It is much more than that, and should legitimately be considered come Oscar season. If this movie cannot earn some consideration by the Academy, they might as well come out and call them the Academy Awards for slow-paced, moody dramas, because this is the best film I have seen in a long time, and that's including the crop that were nominated for best picture last year.

In short, go see this movie. If you, or your friends, or anyone you know has been excited about this movie to come out, then just know that everything that they were excited for is justified.

Go see it - You'll enjoy it, because it's terrific. There's not much more to say.",first thing first thi film is not a comic book movi it is not an action movi to reduc it to these archetyp would be complet unfair to fairli repres thi movi it must be seen for what it is it is a dramat suspens film that will keep you on the edg of your seat for the surprisingli long run time surpris in that it goe by so fast and also that the studio allow christop nolan to cut it thi long batman begin wa seen by most to be a triumph in the comic adapt genr howev it did remain a comic adapt in mani way the dark knight goe beyond that thi film blow suspens up to a citywid level and rais the stake to a breathtak level it recal the suspens natur of film by the like of david fincher ridley scott and even the master alfr hitchcock it craft in such a way that each action seem both inevit and unbeliev and so even for fan of the comic book who believ they know where it is go it is an astound achiev the film look spectacular thank to nolan regular cinematograph walli pfister gotham citi look brighter yet more omin dure the day and danker and more danger at night the perform are a spectacular a mani had expect andor hope bale return in fine form a the titular charact and cant be fault too much eckhart debut a district attorney harvey dent and the storylin effect revolv around him and hi war on organis crime in gotham there are fine support perform from the return gari oldman morgan freeman and michael cain a well a the newcom eric robert nestor carbonel and maggi gyllenha who thank take over from kati holm a bruce wayn childhood friend rachel daw howev if the action centr on harvey dent then the action is heath ledger perform a the maniac joker in one of the finest film perform of the last decad ledger put in what will end up be an unforgett final complet perform that will have almost everyon buzz about a potenti posthum academi award i cannot reiter enough not onli is thi film excel and highli enjoy to watch but it is of such a fine qualiti that it should realli transcend the typic box creat for film that are deem to not contain the correct subject matter much in the way rocki transcend the typic sport movi so thi transcend the typic comic book movi it is much more than that and should legitim be consid come oscar season if thi movi cannot earn some consider by the academi they might a well come out and call them the academi award for slowpac moodi drama becaus thi is the best film i have seen in a long time and that includ the crop that were nomin for best pictur last year in short go see thi movi if you or your friend or anyon you know ha been excit about thi movi to come out then just know that everyth that they were excit for is justifi go see it youll enjoy it becaus it terrif there not much more to say,Positive
"This movie was very well done, but does not compare with most of the movies in the top fifty. Hype has built up this movie, coupled with the over-played fact that Heath Ledger overdosed on medication. While Heath Ledger made the character interesting, his acting does not compare with TRULY emotionally impacting roles. Compare his acting with Jack Nicholson in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". While Heath Ledger's portrayal was effective, the SCRIPT and the director made the movie truly effective. Also, this movie did not possess the intelligence of other Christopher Nolan movies. In my opinion, the best part of Christopher Nolan's movies has always been his manipulation of time. This is the first of his movies that did not make use of this. Movies like Memento and the Prestige made use of time to create a sophisticated twists and turns. These movies did not reach the rating given ""The Dark Knight"" due partly because their sophistication caused them to lose widespread popularity, and also because they were not hyped as large summer blockbusters. The widespread popularity of this movie, as well as undeserved hype, will eventually calm, and this movie will be pushed out of the top fifty.",thi movi wa veri well done but doe not compar with most of the movi in the top fifti hype ha built up thi movi coupl with the overplay fact that heath ledger overdos on medic while heath ledger made the charact interest hi act doe not compar with truli emot impact role compar hi act with jack nicholson in one flew over the cuckoo nest while heath ledger portray wa effect the script and the director made the movi truli effect also thi movi did not possess the intellig of other christoph nolan movi in my opinion the best part of christoph nolan movi ha alway been hi manipul of time thi is the first of hi movi that did not make use of thi movi like memento and the prestig made use of time to creat a sophist twist and turn these movi did not reach the rate given the dark knight due partli becaus their sophist caus them to lose widespread popular and also becaus they were not hype a larg summer blockbust the widespread popular of thi movi a well a undeserv hype will eventu calm and thi movi will be push out of the top fifti,Neutral
"I don't think I have ever seen a movie that has gotten as much hype as this one. I don't think even the 1989 Batman got as much publicity. Too much pre-hype can really hurt a film, I give Snakes On A Plane as an example. I saw it today and wanted to set down my observations. Yes it is a good film with a lot of action. I grew up watching the Adam West Batman, light hearted and campy. The title of this movie is accurate, they do make him as a dark night who has almost as much inner torments and demons as the villains he pursues! He has just not let the darkness overwhelm him. Like everyone else, I was saddened by Heath Ledger's tragic death and I think that might be one of the reasons for the raves about his performance, people see it with their hearts instead of their heads. The truth of the matter is that yes he does give a good turn as the Joker. He brought his considerable talent to the role and truly made it his own. However, he did not for one moment make me forget Jack Nicholson! That was one part Jack was born to play and Ledger was real gutsy to even try, but he didn't come close. Ledger was good but there is only one Jack Nicholson and he is the best.

"usually I don't give a movie score of 10 so quickly after I see it. But I wanna let you all know that if there was more than 10 in the vote,like 100-I would vote on that.

Let me say first that THIS IS the movie of the year.2008. I know that everyone said it's a great movie. But I didn't know I'd love this movie THAT much.

""The Dark Knight"" is,honestly,the best movie I saw this year. Of course I could feel that it was 2 hours and 30 minutes,but I didn't care. After the 2 hours I wanted more. And I got it.

The movie was better than what I expected! And I know that most of the people said that they felt like the movie focused more on the bad guys than Batman, but I again-didn't feel that way.

And how it's possibly for me to end this summary without mention the GREAT Joker-Heath Ledger. I've never seen him act so good,so convincing! and Aaron Eckhart too.

I saw here lately lots of comments that didn't love the movie. Well,I am so glad I didn't read them before I went to the theatre.All those comments would make me sceptical about it.I can tell you to ignore those comments,cause because of them,you'll miss a wonderful movie.

I hope you all will get up from that chair you're sitting on right now-and just run to watch this movie. When there is a work of art like this- it deserves to be valued. I don't really know if this movie deserves to be in 1# place on IMDb top 250 list but I don't think that any movie deserves that. All movies are good in all kind of ways.

"No words could give enough justice to this film. It is truly a masterpiece.

Me and my friend decided to go to see this film in the cinema as we wanted to see Heath Ledger in this final film. I am so glad I went to see this movie. I'll admit that I wasn't sure whether to go and this film at first as I'm not really a big fan of Batman and have never seen any of the other movies to do with Batman.

I am glad I took the chance to go and see The Dark Knight because it was such a treat.

The Joker was my favourite character (and not because Heath Ledger portrayed him). I found myself feeling sorry for the Joker and then not liking him and there has only been one other movie that has made me feel that way (The Godfather).

Christian Bale was great as Batman and in my opinion they could not have cast anyone better for the part. Heath Ledger really did go out with a bang as he astounded me with his acting. The Dark Knight was truly his best role that he has played, well at least that's what I think.

My list of favourite movies always changes but I know that this one will stay at the top for years to come.

"Why is ""The Dark Knight"" so serious? For many good reasons. Christopher Nolan is a true auteur who can take a simplistic comic book story like ""Batman"" and turn it into a complex psychological movie with plethora of character study. He has directed Christian Bale into the most serious Batman character of all. He sure did direct the late Heath Ledger into performing as the best Joker of them all, and Ledger did not work to upstage Bale or the other actors in any way. Ledger should definitely win a posthumous Oscar for his scary performance of a clown who possesses deep wounds.

If Christopher Nolan was old enough, he should have done Batman movies instead of Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher put together. Tim Burton's mood was dark as well, but as I'm looking at it now, Michael Keaton was a more sloppy Batman, Kim Basinger was a mousy Vicky Vale, and Jack Nicholson overdid his Joker performance. In ""Batman Returns,"" also directed by Burton and starring Keaton, the commercialism continues, adding Michelle Pfeiffer as a more idiotic Catwoman than the Catwomen on the 1960s TV series and Danny DeVito, who still was a wounded Penguin, but not enough that we feel sorry for him. Then in the mid 1990s, Keaton didn't want to play Batman anymore, feeling he was upstaged by all the villains. Looking for more actors often typecast as villains, director Schumacher got Tommy Lee Jones to parody his villain persona as Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent. Also, there was still that rubberface persona in Jim Carrey as the Riddler as well. 1997's ""Batman and Robin"" was a total washout. So Nolan came to rescue this moribund franchise and made his own franchise moody with dark colors, mature, less focus on the action and more on the story and detailed development of each character without exploiting them. In 2005, ""Batman Begins"" was just the beginning, but ""The Dark Knight"" is the real story. It would be sin that Christopher Nolan does not get nominated for an Oscar, just as well as Heath Ledger, for best director.

Christian Bale is, and many people would agree with me, the best Batman of them all. With his rich performance, we do know him better than Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, and George Clooney put together. We know Bruce Wayne's haunted past and demons, and why he becomes his alter ego Batman to fight crime in Gotham City. Unlike Cesar Romero and Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger is a much more complicated joker. He doesn't torture people just for pure torture. He doesn't laugh maliciously between every single sentence. He grew up with such an abusive upbringing that he wants to exploit Batman as a fraud for Gotham City, even bringing in Batman clones with the typical Caped Crusader outfit on the crime scenes just to tell Bruce Wayne ""Will the real Batman stand up?""

All the other actors give excellent, detailed performances. Maggie Gyllenhal gives a stronger performance than Katie Holmes (Mrs. Tom Cruise) as Bruce Wayne's love interest Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes, but is smitten with D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in the end. Gary Oldman, in one of his few good-guy roles, does a fine turn as the mustachioed Commissioner Gordon, more serious than the one we've seen on TV. Veteran thespians Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are always a treat to watch as the faithful butler Alfred and the gadget inventor Lucius Fox. These two men get better with age each time they make movies. And Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent not as a torturous villain like Tommy Lee Jones did before, but as a victim wounded by the Joker's torture in a gas chamber out to seek revenge with his coin as his calling card for what could be good or what could better yet turn out for bad on his intended targets.

The summer of 2008 had a lot of movies. I've seen ""Mamma Mia"" as a light feel-good musical comedy riddled with off-key singing, notably by Pierce Brosnan. I've seen ""Wall-E,"" which I thought was Pixar's blander efforts. Remy the rat from last year upstaged this robot on all costs. But ""The Dark Knight"" is the best movie of the summer. When it comes to comic book stories, as I said before, directors Burton and Schumacher got all caught up in themselves with too much action and seemed to forget their audiences. Nolan never does.",whi is the dark knight so seriou for mani good reason christoph nolan is a true auteur who can take a simplist comic book stori like batman and turn it into a complex psycholog movi with plethora of charact studi he ha direct christian bale into the most seriou batman charact of all he sure did direct the late heath ledger into perform a the best joker of them all and ledger did not work to upstag bale or the other actor in ani way ledger should definit win a posthum oscar for hi scari perform of a clown who possess deep wound if christoph nolan wa old enough he should have done batman movi instead of tim burton or joel schumach put togeth tim burton mood wa dark a well but a im look at it now michael keaton wa a more sloppi batman kim basing wa a mousi vicki vale and jack nicholson overdid hi joker perform in batman return also direct by burton and star keaton the commerci continu ad michel pfeiffer a a more idiot catwoman than the catwomen on the s tv seri and danni devito who still wa a wound penguin but not enough that we feel sorri for him then in the mid s keaton didnt want to play batman anymor feel he wa upstag by all the villain look for more actor often typecast a villain director schumach got tommi lee jone to parodi hi villain persona a harvey twofac dent also there wa still that rubberfac persona in jim carrey a the riddler a well s batman and robin wa a total washout so nolan came to rescu thi moribund franchis and made hi own franchis moodi with dark color matur less focu on the action and more on the stori and detail develop of each charact without exploit them in batman begin wa just the begin but the dark knight is the real stori it would be sin that christoph nolan doe not get nomin for an oscar just a well a heath ledger for best director christian bale is and mani peopl would agre with me the best batman of them all with hi rich perform we do know him better than adam west michael keaton val kilmer and georg clooney put togeth we know bruce wayn haunt past and demon and whi he becom hi alter ego batman to fight crime in gotham citi unlik cesar romero and jack nicholson heath ledger is a much more complic joker he doesnt tortur peopl just for pure tortur he doesnt laugh malici between everi singl sentenc he grew up with such an abus upbring that he want to exploit batman a a fraud for gotham citi even bring in batman clone with the typic cape crusad outfit on the crime scene just to tell bruce wayn will the real batman stand up all the other actor give excel detail perform maggi gyllenh give a stronger perform than kati holm mr tom cruis a bruce wayn love interest assist da rachel daw but is smitten with da harvey dent aaron eckhart in the end gari oldman in one of hi few goodguy role doe a fine turn a the mustachio commission gordon more seriou than the one weve seen on tv veteran thespian michael cain and morgan freeman are alway a treat to watch a the faith butler alfr and the gadget inventor luciu fox these two men get better with age each time they make movi and aaron eckhart play harvey twofac dent not a a tortur villain like tommi lee jone did befor but a a victim wound by the joker tortur in a ga chamber out to seek reveng with hi coin a hi call card for what could be good or what could better yet turn out for bad on hi intend target the summer of had a lot of movi ive seen mamma mia a a light feelgood music comedi riddl with offkey sing notabl by pierc brosnan ive seen wall which i thought wa pixar blander effort remi the rat from last year upstag thi robot on all cost but the dark knight is the best movi of the summer when it come to comic book stori a i said befor director burton and schumach got all caught up in themselv with too much action and seem to forget their audienc nolan never doe,Positive

"Heath, Heath, Heath, yada yada yada. Yes, he did a lovely Joker. So what? The film was almost as tedious as the rest of them. The obvious problems:

* Too long!

* Shallow stabs at moral seriousness.

* Absurdly over-processed Batman voice.

* The usual barely-there female characters.

* Heath's Joker was just another lunatic villain, and we've seen plenty of similar quality over the years. *gasp*  heresy!

Yes, in my opinion, Heath was merely okay.

Making a villainous virtue out of the Joker having no purpose but to ""make the world burn"" is not ""deep."" It's not that hard to create a charismatic psycho character. Yes, he had some game. Yes, of course, I enjoyed lines like ""I wouldn't know what to do with it if I caught one."" This movie wasn't completely awful. I'm giving it five stars, after all (which guarantees no one will read my comment, but oh well).

But neither Heath nor the film as a whole was ""amazing.""

I'm not a superhero movie hater, and I've actually read plenty of Batman comics in my life (unlike at least half the people getting excited about this film, I think). But I have been bored and disappointed by the Batman franchise films every time, so this is no surprise. I can't even wrap my head around this one being fun, light entertainment (or any other kind of entertainment), let alone a ""classic"" as so many are calling it.

"Unfortunately, this is a movie that just didn't know where to go most of the time. We have an almost three hour movie that really feels longer and doesn't know where to go and when to stop.

First of all, let's talk about Heath Ledger's performance. The hype is absolutely justified. He lights up the screen with his performance and the film is delightful when he is on the screen. Part of the problem is that no other characters are equally as interesting and that includes Christian Bale as Batman. There is not all that much charisma in Christian Bale's characterization as Bruce Wayne and none of the other characters grab the screen the way Heath Ledger does, so the movie doesn't really give Heath Ledger much to play off of most of the time. Eric Roberts, almost unrecognizable probably due to the work that has been done on his face, has some acting moments in a minor role that cause a stir. I always liked him and wish I saw more of him.

Meanwhile, the film has so many twists and turns that do nothing more than confuse, I felt more like I was in a maze that I couldn't get out of rather than on a roller coaster ride. Just when I thought there might be a resolution to the film, yet another plot twist, a new discovery would occur. I found myself looking at my watch after about an hour and a half or so, and the movie was only half over! The first part of the film, that is to say, the first hour, was more character setup and that was far more interesting. The first part of the film relied more on dialogue and there was quite a bit of evident wit. But when the plot points started getting laid on thick and heavy, I got restless and continued to get more so. At film's end, I ended up thinking ""So what?"". I was glad to have seen Heath Ledger's performance, but not much more than that. I felt, other than for Ledger, the film wasted my time (and money).",unfortun thi is a movi that just didnt know where to go most of the time we have an almost three hour movi that realli feel longer and doesnt know where to go and when to stop first of all let talk about heath ledger perform the hype is absolut justifi he light up the screen with hi perform and the film is delight when he is on the screen part of the problem is that no other charact are equal a interest and that includ christian bale a batman there is not all that much charisma in christian bale character a bruce wayn and none of the other charact grab the screen the way heath ledger doe so the movi doesnt realli give heath ledger much to play off of most of the time eric robert almost unrecogniz probabl due to the work that ha been done on hi face ha some act moment in a minor role that caus a stir i alway like him and wish i saw more of him meanwhil the film ha so mani twist and turn that do noth more than confus i felt more like i wa in a maze that i couldnt get out of rather than on a roller coaster ride just when i thought there might be a resolut to the film yet anoth plot twist a new discoveri would occur i found myself look at my watch after about an hour and a half or so and the movi wa onli half over the first part of the film that is to say the first hour wa more charact setup and that wa far more interest the first part of the film reli more on dialogu and there wa quit a bit of evid wit but when the plot point start get laid on thick and heavi i got restless and continu to get more so at film end i end up think so what i wa glad to have seen heath ledger perform but not much more than that i felt other than for ledger the film wast my time and money,Neutral

It's marvelous how Nolan succeeded to present in one movie Batman that is so realistic and that we can connect to it and really be pulled into movie and that he preserves all craziness of Joker that is demanded from his character. Batman movie can be done in various ways and one reason is because Batman and his greatest enemy have no superpowers and I see that as a good thing because then you have more space and need to present these characters not as someone who can really exist but as someone who put you more into movie and unreal world of comic book at the same time.

"""Batman Begins"" is certainly a great movie. It had its weaknesses, such as the lack of a strong villain and a finale that left me a bit disappointed. Christopher Nolan's interpretation of the character was certainly the darkest and most down to earth that we'd seen up until that point. Its sequel film manages to do something truly spectacular and blow that movie out of the water.

The dichotomy between the Joker (Heath Ledger) and Batman (Christian Bale) is what makes this film a modern classic. The Joker acts as a force of pure malicious evil. And Batman acts as a force of pure incorruptible good. In all honesty though, the Joker is the main character of this film. It is he who drives the plot forward. And saying that Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest villain performances of all time shouldn't be taken lightly, especially when other Academy Award winning actors have also done tremendous things with the character. Ledger's Joker is a completely different beast, a truly vicious and terrifying psychopath. He absolutely elevates this already stupendous crime drama to a higher level.

Often downplayed by other reviewers, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) also plays a crucial role. The pureness of both Batman and the Joker in their respective sides is contrasted by a man who is completely neutral and leaves every decision to chance. Although every performance in this movie is naturally overshadowed by Ledger's, Eckhart does a great job as well. As do Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman. A truly stellar cast.

The cinematography and action sequences are great. Amazing visuals that you expect out of a Nolan film.

Not much else to say about this classic. It deserves all of the adulation and recognition that it receives. It is in a completely different league above all other superhero films in that it places us in a dark, gritty, and macabre world, where the heroes are truly heroic and the villains are truly villainous.",batman begin is certainli a great movi it had it weak such a the lack of a strong villain and a final that left me a bit disappoint christoph nolan interpret of the charact wa certainli the darkest and most down to earth that wed seen up until that point it sequel film manag to do someth truli spectacular and blow that movi out of the water the dichotomi between the joker heath ledger and batman christian bale is what make thi film a modern classic the joker act a a forc of pure malici evil and batman act a a forc of pure incorrupt good in all honesti though the joker is the main charact of thi film it is he who drive the plot forward and say that heath ledger give one of the greatest villain perform of all time shouldnt be taken lightli especi when other academi award win actor have also done tremend thing with the charact ledger joker is a complet differ beast a truli viciou and terrifi psychopath he absolut elev thi alreadi stupend crime drama to a higher level often downplay by other review harvey dent aaron eckhart also play a crucial role the pure of both batman and the joker in their respect side is contrast by a man who is complet neutral and leav everi decis to chanc although everi perform in thi movi is natur overshadow by ledger eckhart doe a great job a well a do bale michael cain morgan freeman and gari oldman a truli stellar cast the cinematographi and action sequenc are great amaz visual that you expect out of a nolan film not much el to say about thi classic it deserv all of the adul and recognit that it receiv it is in a complet differ leagu abov all other superhero film in that it place u in a dark gritti and macabr world where the hero are truli heroic and the villain are truli villain,Positive

"""The Dark Knight,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic triumph that redefines the superhero genre. Released in 2008, it stands as one of the most iconic and influential superhero movies to date. Here's a review of this remarkable film.

Christopher Nolan's direction is impeccable. He crafts a dark and gritty atmosphere that befits Gotham's grim world. The film's cinematography, with its sweeping shots of the city, captures the essence of a modern noir thriller. The action sequences are intense, and the practical effects add a visceral quality to the film.

""The Dark Knight"" is not just a superhero movie; it's a deep exploration of complex themes. It raises questions about morality, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices made for the greater good. The film challenges viewers to ponder the fine line between hero and antihero.",the dark knight direct by christoph nolan is a cinemat triumph that redefin the superhero genr releas in it stand a one of the most icon and influenti superhero movi to date here a review of thi remark film christoph nolan direct is impecc he craft a dark and gritti atmospher that befit gotham grim world the film cinematographi with it sweep shot of the citi captur the essenc of a modern noir thriller the action sequenc are intens and the practic effect add a viscer qualiti to the film the dark knight is not just a superhero movi it a deep explor of complex theme it rais question about moral the natur of evil and the sacrific made for the greater good the film challeng viewer to ponder the fine line between hero and antihero,Positive

"This film is basically average.

NONE of the performances in this film are anything worth getting over exited about. Heath Ledger's performance was good. It wasn't amazing, it wasn't even great. Just like Ian Curtis his death did him the world of good. I'm not saying he wasn't a capable actor; I'm simply saying he wasn't anything special.

Have we reached an age where licking your lips and snuffling is regarded as 'a performance that should earn him every award known to man'?

He is only regarded as being so super good because he's dead - simple as that.

"For many years, I have wanted to see this movie. I had heard various opinions praising the performances, the scenery, the soundtrack... However, I never got to see it, until today. And, after seeing it, I can affirm that it is a contender to be one of the best films in history. There is no criticizable point. Heath Ledger's performance is one of the best performances ever given on the big screen, and even the secondary characters shine. The city has a tone of horror, suffering and fear, just as someone would imagine Gotham, and all this thanks to the excellent setting that this feature film presents, both in terms of the scenery and the music, composed by the famous Hans Zimmer. Last but not least is the plot, and I can firmly say that it is one of the best I have ever heard in my life. I still can't assimilate how well the Joker's plans are made, worthy of a crazy but charismatic and cunning villain.

"The Dark Knight is the peak of cinema, and if you disagree, this is at least the peak of cinema for DC. Joker is absolutely iconic and has some good jokes, but you can't help but feel that he is a true threat. With the previous movie in the trilogy, the villain had certain goals to cleanse society; they weren't completely immoral. Heath Ledger's Joker stops at nothing. His goal is to make chaos, and as a great butler once said, ""Some people just want to watch the world burn"", which is perfect description for this character, testing to see how even merely mentions of his future actions can drive the world into a craze.",the dark knight is the peak of cinema and if you disagre thi is at least the peak of cinema for dc joker is absolut icon and ha some good joke but you cant help but feel that he is a true threat with the previou movi in the trilog the villain had certain goal to clean societi they werent complet immor heath ledger joker stop at noth hi goal is to make chao and a a great butler onc said some peopl just want to watch the world burn which is perfect descript for thi charact test to see how even mere mention of hi futur action can drive the world into a craze,Neutral

Once you rewatch it, and actually think about the message that it sends about society, villains, and how certain sacrifices must be made for the greater good, even if we don't agree with them.

"Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

"This movie is too long by about 30 minutes. I was happy when the screen finally went dark. A filmmaker should be able to get his point across in under 2 hours or before the collective audience ass starts hurting.

It's a comic book and the effects and makeup are really great, but still, some of it is too inexplicable and so beyond the possible that it undermines the characters. The Joker is deliciously strange and evil but if he can arrange those events that are so very complex, he starts to look more like a circus ringleader whose dancing dogs and fireworks are the real characters.

The story was very hard for me to follow. I don't appreciate having to try so hard to figure out what and why things happen in a movie. I am still not sure why Mr. ""Two Face"" went sour and frankly I didn't care that he did.

There is a very heavy thematic effort here; much of film is trying to clearly define good vs. evil and the shifting ambiguity of that, to end with Batman becoming rather dark and isolated.

"I sat down with this movie after knowing that most people loved and seemed to venerate it. But I have a lot of perspective. I was reading Batman comics back in 1957, and I have seen all of the greatest movies ever made. This just isn't one of them. I did not care about anyone. The action was remorseless and unnecessary, one could even say gratuitous. I even turned it off by the 2-hour mark because it got so maudlin and disjointed. I did read something about people voting this into fifth position of the greatest 250 movies ever made, and clearly this shows the weight of current voters who have little experience with good movies. Why, they should be asked, does Citizen Kane, a 1941 movie always rank as the best movie ever? Because it had story, wonderful acting, human nature, and on and on, all things missing from Dark Knight.

Movies today are thrown together with lots of action, preposterous stories, and computer effects. Characters survive falls and bangs that would put anyone, including a linebacker for the NFL, in hospital for a week or more. As with another reviewer, I am now finding it hard to remember to much about this movie, but I can remember every scene in a great movie, like The Maltese Falcon, etc.",i sat down with thi movi after know that most peopl love and seem to vener it but i have a lot of perspect i wa read batman comic back in and i have seen all of the greatest movi ever made thi just isnt one of them i did not care about anyon the action wa remorseless and unnecessari one could even say gratuit i even turn it off by the hour mark becaus it got so maudlin and disjoint i did read someth about peopl vote thi into fifth posit of the greatest movi ever made and clearli thi show the weight of current voter who have littl experi with good movi whi they should be ask doe citizen kane a movi alway rank a the best movi ever becaus it had stori wonder act human natur and on and on all thing miss from dark knight movi today are thrown togeth with lot of action preposter stori and comput effect charact surviv fall and bang that would put anyon includ a lineback for the nfl in hospit for a week or more a with anoth review i am now find it hard to rememb to much about thi movi but i can rememb everi scene in a great movi like the maltes falcon etc,Neutral

"Batman: The Dark Knight improves on everything from Begins and I mean everything, this film has next to no flaws. It's Christopher Nolan at his finest, creating a film that everyone can like, superhero fan or not. The brilliant storytelling is there, so is the breathtaking cinematography and of course the superb direction from Nolan. It doesn't matter if you're a fan of Batman or superhero films in general for this movie, it's after all considered to be one of the best films of its decade and one of the greatest and most influential films of all time. The film received eight nominations at the Oscars, winning the award for Best Sound Editing and Best Supporting Actor for Ledger's performance as the Joker. In 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"", becoming the second superhero film after 1978's Superman to earn the honor.

When the menace known as the Joker wreaks havoc and chaos on the people of Gotham, Batman must accept one of the greatest psychological and physical tests of his ability to fight injustice.

Christian Bale portrays Bruce Wayne and Batman, doing both the physical part as Batman and the dramatic part of Bruce Wayne, giving each his all and ultimately giving us one of the best live action portrayals of the Dark Knight. There is so many things Bale does right and I love his take on the iconic Caped Crusader, but there are people who have some criticism towards him and that's completely fine. Though he wasn't perfect in Batman Begins, Bale have truly grown into the role and with his method acting he doesn't let the audience or himself down, Bale's take on the character is perfect for Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy. Heath Ledger plays The Joker and he took Method Acting to the extreme, earning himself many awards along with an oscar. The great and memorable performances doesn't stop with Bale and Ledger, they're joined by talented actors like: Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. Along with a supporting cast. They capture the comic book versions of the characters and successfully brings quality and fantastic performance to the film, many are extremely memorable like Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart, they're simply award worthy. Michael Caine deserves a lot of praise for his role as Alfred, his portrayal is my favorite of all live action portrayals.

""You Either Die A Hero Or Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become The Villain."" that's a quote anyone will recognize, the writing is spectacular. From the characters, to dialogue, to world building. The screenplay are simply impressive and fantastic in so many ways. The screenplay is written by Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan, but the story was co-written by David S. Goyer. I just can't praise the writers enough. There's various of themes in the film, most are mature and I'll just say it now, it's a dark movie but done perfectly. Some themes are: The Triumph of Evil Over Good, Justice versus Corruption, The Thin Line Between Anarchy and Order and The Terrible Logic of Human Nature. Honestly, the film could easily be looked at as a black and white story with Batman being the good and Joker the bad, but Christopher Nolan takes the story in a grey area that makes you question things, especially those themes I just wrote down, and he succeeds perfectly.

Batman: The Dark Knight is full of beautifully crafted and just terrific set pieces, done by how they kept everything grounded with practical effects instead of relying on CGI. Some sequences that just show how great looking film it is, for an example the Bank Heist which was shot entirely in IMAX and it looks fantastic from start to finish with its musical score and incredible direction and cinematography, other sequences worth mentioning are the action sequence when Nolan literally flipped a truck over. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stop there, but there's so many brilliant and memorable action sequences in this film, what Nolan succeeded in doing is to keep the tension and suspension going and the tempo never slows down. Wally Pfister and Christopher Nolan is to thank for the stunning set pieces, the cinematographer and director. Wally Pfister actually got nominated for an Oscar for his work in this film, an award he was worthy of winning. With The Dark Knight Trilogy, things were to be as grounded and realistic as possible which I thank Christopher Nolan for. It shows in the visual effects, the sets and especially the sound editing. Overall an incredible experience from start to finish with every scene thought out 100%, with foreshadowing and symbolism. The Dark Knight does it extremely well.

Experiencing this trilogy for the first time in 4K, starting with Batman Begins and now The Dark Knight. I just have to say it's brilliant and the right way to watch the film. The HDR is perfect and truly captures the cinematic picture Nolan wanted for these releases, making it the closest to a theatrical viewing. The soundtrack is superb, the music and everything are truly phenomenal. Hans Zimmer worked with James Newton Howard in creating the unique and powerful musical score, a truly mesmerizing one. It's still a mind blowing experience to watch after all these times, and a film I'll continue to rewatch. If not for the beautiful cinematography and direction, it's the acting and characterization, but also its action sequences and top notch visual effects. There's so much to enjoy in this film, from the heroes to its villains and everything in between, The Dark Knight is what The Return of the King is to Lord of the Rings, a masterpiece.",batman the

"First of all let me start by saying this film is in the elite list of best ever sequels. Only a few sequels in film history have been better than the first, this film is one of the best examples of that. The first in the trilogy was a solid movie, but what The Dark Knight did was take it to that next level, it brought in some of the best characters in a genius way and elevated it to a modern classic.

A lot of this films success is down to the perfect casting, Christian Bale reprising his role as Bruce Wayne / Batman, Heath Ledger taking on the Joker in what can be described as one of the best on screen performances in history, to Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman as James Gordon, although the last 3 characters are supporting, they truly do make the film and give you the heart of the movie.

What Christopher Nolan did when making this movie was redefine a genre, every comic book movie since has tried to do what he did with this movie but just hasn't been able to capture the same spark. There will always be Batman but I truly believe this will be the one everyone looks to for many years as the greatest of all.

"There's one thing about ""The Dark Knight"" that I just don't get... why? Why do so much people make it out to be something that it's not? I don't call it a masterpiece for enough reasons.

1) I didn't find it gripping, and I thought it was schmaltzy as hell, just like all the movies I see these days

2) Sure, it was good, but it's not a masterpiece because I don't call it groundbreaking, despite the fact that it made a helluva lot of money and was the biggest-grossing movie of 2008. Honestly, even I've seen better and I'm almost 17! I don't think it's the kind of movie that leaves a mark on the worldwide consciousness and it doesn't mean much to me personally

3) It was WAY, WAY, over-anticipated.

I honestly don't know if there's any ground left to break, but sure, we can still show audiences that artistry and business shouldn't be two different things. I'd really like to see Hollywood do more stuff like that. Bottom line, what was good back in the Golden Age is still good now. I think both the American people and people all over the world can still handle craftsmanship. I gave the movie 6 stars out of 10 just to be generous.

I'd love to see someone pull it off but I don't know if they'd have the guts.

To call ""The Dark Knight"" a masterpiece is to say that the viewer clearly has not seen a wide range of films.

"Let's start with Batman's last line ""You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain"". This movie is surely the best of the year so far and deservedly so.

I'll keep it short...all the characters and are given a worth time on screen(although i still want more of heath:p).

The direction is superb as well is the acting by whole cast, even the small characters of Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are very well dealt with.

But the most important person who steals the show is one and truly MR.Heath Ledger; even Batman looks a bit frightened by him(look at the eyes of batman when he interacts with joker in cell).

This is easily the best batman movie and way better than ""Begins"".

So i'll just say watch it even if u are not familiar with batman franchise.

Watch it simply for the cynicism of heath ledger and u'll know why is there an Oscar buzz.

I'm finally starting to understand Heath Ledger's Joker performance. I now think it's great. I think the point is that it is such a facade it leaves you wondering what is behind that facade, and then you realise there's nothing there. That is what makes the performance so terrifying. The Joker IS the mask. Who is wearing it?

A criticism I have now heard from a few people about this movie - a movie nobody dared to criticise for years - is that there should have been only one villain. Joker was enough. I now feel inclined to agree. Harvey Dent is a great character, but Two-Face feels unnecessary. His descent into bad guy mode, after being a true hero, also feels unwarranted. Such a massive turnaround probably needed a whole movie to explain. Instead Two-Face gets Joker's leftovers.

I also feel the movie was too long.

"To start, I would like to say that this movie is not even as good as Batman Begins. Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors, Batman is one of the best super heroes, but that still does not mean this equates to The Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather.

This is a very good movie, but it is not deserving of all of the hype surrounding it. Health Ledger's death had more of an impact on this movie's critical acclaim than anything in the actual movie. The Joker is pretty cool because the screen writers made him cool, not because Health Ledger delivered an Oscar worthy performance or any of that other BS. People seem to forget that Liam Neeson played his character in Begins at least as well if not better than Heath Ledger played The Joker. Also, Christian Bale is predominately playing his snobby Bruce Wayne character in this film, which is quite annoying. After seeing the movie, you might even realize that Christian Bale's obscure placement throughout the film is a major flaw.

The Godfather is around 3 hours, this is around 2&1/2 hours, yet this movie feels much slower. Rather than keeping a steady pace, the movie seems to doze off for a while followed by huge explosions and overly drawn out 30 minute action sequences. It's ridiculous.

"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is not just a superhero film; it's a cinematic spectacle that redefines the genre, setting an unparalleled standard for storytelling, character development, and technical brilliance. Released in 2008, this second installment of Nolan's Batman trilogy is a brooding, intense masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of comic book adaptations.

At the core of ""The Dark Knight"" is the late Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, a performance that stands as one of the most mesmerizing in cinematic history. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, an embodiment of anarchy that leaves an indelible mark on Gotham City. His nuanced and chilling performance posthumously earned him an Academy Award, a testament to his dedication and the depth he brought to the character.

Christian Bale, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, delivers a compelling performance, grappling not only with the physical challenges of crime-fighting but also with the moral complexities of being a symbol for justice. The film introduces Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, Gotham's charismatic district attorney, whose tragic transformation into Two-Face adds a layer of moral ambiguity that elevates the narrative.

Nolan's direction is nothing short of visionary. He creates a Gotham that is gritty, realistic, and morally complex. The film's practical effects, breathtaking cinematography by Wally Pfister, and Hans Zimmer's haunting score contribute to the immersive experience. The use of IMAX cameras for key sequences, including the legendary chase scene, sets ""The Dark Knight"" apart as a technical marvel.

The screenplay, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is a labyrinth of moral dilemmas and psychological depth. It explores themes of chaos, morality, and the thin line between hero and villain. The Joker's philosophy challenges Batman's very existence, pushing the Caped Crusader to confront the darkness within himself.

""The Dark Knight"" is not just a superhero film; it's a crime drama, a character study, and a gripping exploration of the human psyche. The film's pacing is relentless, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Nolan's commitment to practical effects and a gripping narrative sets a benchmark that subsequent superhero films aspire to reach.

In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight"" is a triumph of storytelling and filmmaking. It transcends the superhero genre, leaving an enduring impact on both cinema and popular culture. Ledger's Joker is not just a villain; he's an enigma, a force of chaos that mirrors the complexities of the human condition. ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic gem that continues to resonate, proving that even in the realm of caped crusaders, artistry and depth can coexist.",christoph nolan the dark knight is not just a superhero film it a cinemat spectacl that redefin the genr set an unparallel standard for storytel charact develop and technic brillianc releas in thi second instal of nolan batman trilog is a brood intens masterpiec that transcend the boundari of comic book adapt at the core of the dark knight is the late heath ledger icon portray of the joker a perform that stand a one of the most mesmer in cinemat histori ledger joker is a chaotic forc of natur an embodi of anarchi that leav an indel mark on gotham citi hi nuanc and chill perform posthum earn him an academi award a testament to hi dedic and the depth he brought to the charact christian bale repris hi role a bruce waynebatman deliv a compel perform grappl not onli with the physic challeng of crimefight but also with the moral complex of be a symbol for justic the film introduc aaron eckhart a harvey dent gotham charismat district attorney whose tragic transform into twofac add a layer of moral ambigu that elev the narr nolan direct is noth short of visionari he creat a gotham that is gritti realist and moral complex the film practic effect breathtak cinematographi by walli pfister and han zimmer haunt score contribut to the immers experi the use of imax camera for key sequenc includ the legendari chase scene set the dark knight apart a a technic marvel the screenplay cowritten by nolan and hi brother jonathan is a labyrinth of moral dilemma and psycholog depth it explor theme of chao moral and the thin line between hero and villain the joker philosophi challeng batman veri exist push the cape crusad to confront the dark within himself the dark knight is not just a superhero film it a crime drama a charact studi and a grip explor of the human psych the film pace is relentless keep audienc on the edg of their seat from start to finish nolan commit to practic effect and a grip narr set a benchmark that subsequ superhero film aspir to reach in conclus the dark knight is a triumph of storytel and filmmak it transcend the superhero genr leav an endur impact on both cinema and popular cultur ledger joker is not just a villain he an enigma a forc of chao that mirror the complex of the human condit the dark knight is a cinemat gem that continu to reson prove that even in the realm of cape crusad artistri and depth can coexist,Neutral

Batman History: Gone are the days when Adam West's campy Batman T.V series used to be the only source of ""Bat Entertainment"" for the audience. The Batman movies of the 90s did not do justice to the great comic book icon. They all made the caped crusader appear as a happy-go-lucky masked vigilante who saved the day at the end with his ""Bat Gadgets"". Where was the character development? A real plot? (Oh please, not the penguin-stole-candy-from-a-baby plot). The superficial storyline and lack of commitment catalysed the fiasco of the Batman franchise. All in all, much to the dismay of fans, a costly costume party was all that we ever saw!

A Knight was born: 'Batman Begins"" at last delved into the dark and troubled past of Bruce Wayne. A man trying to find his identity, conquer his worst fears and overcome the grief of the unjust murder of his parents. A man who becomes invincible as a symbol. The magic of this movie lies in the fact that although it is not real, it makes you want to believe that it is!

The Dark Knight: The success of Batman Begins opened the flood gates of great expectations and surreal anticipation for perhaps one of the most awaited movie sequels, let alone a Batman sequel. With expectations and speculations running wild, the overzealous promotion and media hype knew no bounds. The Dark Knight was put under microscope long before its scheduled release. The tragic loss of Heath Hedger, especially after whispers of his alleged over-the-top performance, added fuel to the fire. With fans and critics eagerly waiting to sing praise or eviscerate the movie alike, Dark Knight made a smashing entry! The question is, did this movie deliver? Did it live up to the unrealistic expectations of the fans? No. It surpassed it! This movie is not just for fans of Batman, but for all those who love to see a masterpiece. It certainly stretched the limitations of a typical comic book movie. The Joker is not just the avergae psychotic villain who blows things up and deliver jabs and witty retorts. No no no no no! He is more than that. A lot more than that. His every word has a deep psychological connotation to it. He poses moral dilemmas that play with the boundaries of normal ethical conduct and human psyche. Simply put, he puts people under the microscope and test their reaction under extreme situations. And he does it with flair! That's the beauty of it. He creates ingenious situations and traps that tricks everybody into believing something, while something else is happening. Bruce Wayne is pushed to such extremes that he thinks that his days as the caped crusader are coming to an end... As Rachel puts it, ""Bruce don't make me your only hope for a normal life"". We also find that The Joker and Batman have a lot in common. Joker pretty much sums up the entire comic book history between him and Batman as ""You and I are destined to do this forever""... Although they are portrayed as freaks with troubed childhood, it all comes down to the choices that people make at testing times. Harvey and Bruce are both influenced by The Joker's brilliant yet fiendish schemes and the outcome is colossal... You've gotta see it for yourself! This so much more than an action movie. A psychological thriller? Perhaps. The way Joker manipulates human nature is simply ""mind blowing"". Believe me, he is more than what you expect him to be in every single moment of the movie. His influence on Harvey Dent is even more intriguing than it is on the rest. And the fact that special effects are less prominent compared to character development and storyline goes to show that drama and theatrics impacts people on a personal level that all the CGI in the world cannot conjure up. It simply makes you care for the character rather than being a mute spectator of a violent showdown. This movie revolves around deep forgotten fears, traumas, hope, faith and courage. This is poetry in movie making!

"Let me preface this comment by saying I'm not a huge fan of comic books or comic book movies by default, but I do enjoy the genre if it's done well. I really enjoyed Batman Begins, and the Frank Miller take on Batman in the Dark Knight Returns. As much as I liked them however, they felt like a ""comic-book"". Not to deride the genre, but if you read a lot of comic books you probably know what I mean when I say this. There's a certain level of cheese and immaturity associated with any character that straps on tights and an animal-themed costume to battle crime.

However, the question that kept going through my mind when watching the Dark Knight was ""Is this really a comic-book movie?"" And I think that's no accident. Chris Nolan is certainly a master of his art and every choice that was made in this movie seemed to spring out of this idea. The sepia tone is out, replaced with a more ultra-realist look: when it's night, it's dark and when it's day it's light. The characters are somewhat over-the-top but ultimately believable: the word superhero and supervillain is never used in the movie, and even their comic-book names seem to be rarely (if ever) uttered. And the action is cool, but hardly over-the-top. The only thing that's really ""comic-book"" about the movie is Batman's costume, which is made about as practical as possible while still staying true to the character. It's all tied together with a rock-solid script that asks tough, thought-provoking questions, yet never gives way to a dull moment (in fact, it was so intense I think it gave me heart palpitations).

Certainly a risky move to pull in a film that's appealing to an audience that is generally looked down upon by the mass media. But I think Nolan (and his brother) give their audience much more credit than the typical movie maker and it pays off--well, it did for me.

What I'm trying to say is this movie is good. It's so good you may, like me, find yourself questioning your definition of ""comic-book"" movie.",let me prefac thi comment by say im not a huge fan of comic book or comic book movi by default but i do enjoy the genr if it done well i realli enjoy batman begin and the frank miller take on batman in the dark knight return a much a i like them howev they felt like a comicbook not to derid the genr but if you read a lot of comic book you probabl know what i mean when i say thi there a certain level of chees and immatur associ with ani charact that strap on tight and an animalthem costum to battl crime howev the question that kept go through my mind when watch the dark knight wa is thi realli a comicbook movi and i think that no accid chri nolan is certainli a master of hi art and everi choic that wa made in thi movi seem to spring out of thi idea the sepia tone is out replac with a more ultrarealist look when it night it dark and when it day it light the charact are somewhat overthetop but ultim believ the word superhero and supervillain is never use in the movi and even their comicbook name seem to be rare if ever utter and the action is cool but hardli overthetop the onli thing that realli comicbook about the movi is batman costum which is made about a practic a possibl while still stay true to the charact it all tie togeth with a rocksolid script that ask tough thoughtprovok question yet never give way to a dull moment in fact it wa so intens i think it gave me heart palpit certainli a riski move to pull in a film that appeal to an audienc that is gener look down upon by the mass medium but i think nolan and hi brother give their audienc much more credit than the typic movi maker and it pay offwel it did for me what im tri to say is thi movi is good it so good you may like me find yourself question your definit of comicbook movi,Negative
"Naturally, ""The Dark Knight"" doesn't deserve a #1 spot on a Top 250 list (it's ranked #1 on IMDb with a 9.4/10 rating out of 156, 218 votes as of July 28, 2008), but that's a silly discussion since everyone has a different favourite film and you can't expect ""Citizen Kane"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (neither of these is my fave, by the way) to be more popular than (good or bad) summer blockbusters on a virtual world populated mostly by teenagers who dig Michael Bay's flicks (and I hate to sound so arrogant here, I'm not trying to imply young people have no taste, I barely left my teenage years myself... but that's the average public, right?), thus these lists shouldn't be taken too seriously.

That said, ""The Dark Knight"" promises and delivers, more than living up to the hype. Christopher Nolan made something even bigger and better than his ""Batman Begins"" (2005), topping Tim Burton's first two installments of the series (and let's not even mention Joel Schumacher's name... he doesn't need to be humiliated any more than he's been - let's just forget he exists). The movie works in epic proportions as the possible greatest superhero movie ever made, and easily the most exciting action movie in many years (and this is coming from someone who doesn't dig action flicks that much). The cast (Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman) is also the best in the whole series, and Ledger is clearly the standout (and trust me, he's THAT good, and all that praise isn't because of sentimental reasons): his Joker is a blast, psychotic, scary, hilarious and darkly charismatic. And if the buzz makes it to the end of the year, I can definitely see him getting a well deserved posthumous Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. Whether you're a huge Batman fan or just want a perfect summer flick, ""The Dark Knight"" shall not let you down.

"I know there were a lot of hype and excitement about this film, but I think it's the weakest in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. Though it does have some strong movie elements such as good special effects, high drama and a haunting music score, this film is too dark even for Batman. The plot drags, action and violence are overkill and some of the cast performances were weak.

As a fan of the comics, I was hoping that this trilogy would follow the comic continuity more than the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher series. But, it wasn't meant to be.

We have a story about Batman trying to rid the city of the remaining mobs, but ended up facing a new villain, the Joker. Later on in the story, crime-fighting Harvey Dent flips a nerve and turn into Two-Face. While pretty good acting, Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was too manic and sadistic. I didn't care for the make-up and costume as well. Aaron Eckhart's performance of Harvey Dent/Two-Face drove me off the wall - bland as Harvey Dent and much too angry as Two-Face.

I know Director Nolan wanted to avoid camp at all cost after what we've went through with Schumacher's films, but the story is too serious and dark. I would highly recommend ""Batman Begins"" or ""The Dark Knight Rises"" over this. While also dark, those two films had much better character development, compelling plots and a better balance of humor.

"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy.

"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us.

Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.

The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!",i had the pleasur to watch thi movi in an imax theatr in london it advertis itself with the slogan biggest screen in the uk which wa one of the greatest movi experi i had in my life and it wa my first movi in an imax theatr i can onli recommend it for anyon who ha the chanc to watch it even if not the entir movi is shot for an imax theatr thi still is abl to blow someon away great visual combin with a great stori and superb act the movi could also have been call the joker but even with heath ledger great perform thi still is a batman movi and the dark knight is clear enough even without the batman in the titl i simpli love the movi but i heard some complaint from some friend it seem that some might have a problem with the depict of the charact i love heath ledger but there are a few out there who would have want to see him even crazier or the plot thread especi what is done with the charact of aaron eckhart although i can see whi that might be a problem for fan of the comic book i still stand by my vote thi is the best batman movi ever until hope nolan and bale make the next one,Neutral
"Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.

You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....

This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn't been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?",do you realli think thi wa a better film than the godfath the good the bad and the ugli the seven samurai pulp fiction ok the joker wa a stand out perform and the rest were good but wa thi realli the best film of all time cant see how that happen and in year thi will sink to the middl of the pile where it should be you want an examin of good and evil and the dualiti of man watch the king of new york it a better film than thi im not say it not worth see but plea thi is not the best film of all time thi may be the best batman film weve seen but frankli i enjoy iron man more the action wa good the stori reason and there were some good support act but the whole experi doesnt move you like the shawshank redempt it wasnt a seismic shift in filmmak like pulp fiction or the godfath the direct better than sergio leon the film hasnt been hype that much so where is thi come from,Neutral
"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace.

"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home.

"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film.

In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie.

"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.

Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.

Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.

And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.

The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made.",when i went to the cinema to see indiana jone i rememb see a trailer for the dark knight it wa dark full of explos and look realli cool be a huge fan of batman and the two burton film i couldnt wait to see it while i never saw it in cinema i rememb my friend tell me it wa amaz and one of the best film ever fast forward to when i final got to see the film and it wa a differ stori two and a half hour of the most pretenti bore and disappoint film i had ever seen let start with the plot basic the joker atleast that what they call him start kill peopl and caus mayhem mean batman ha to stop him sound simpl but the film spoil thi by have too mani plot line most of which have noth to do with the actual plot dont last long enough to be interest and could have been easili cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot now for the hero and villain batman is play by christian bale and come complet with an over the top gruff voic which sound like he smoke a entir packet of cigarett while do a cross countri marathon he nowher near a dark or a intimid a keaton batman and isnt veri engag a bruce either now for the reason the film is consid to be so great heath ledger a the joker ledger is the main drive point of the film and the most interest charact he play the role veri convincingli and ill admit is the best part of the film even though they could have call him anyth el instead of the joker and it would have been the same and that my biggest problem with thi film it doesnt feel like a batman film batman ha alway been a surreal franchis mean it walk on a line between the real world and a fantasi world whi doe gotham citi just look like and regular citi whi doe the joker not have ani comic death contrapt whi doe the batmobil look like a tank where are all batman uniqu gadget the problem is nolan doesnt understand that a man who dress up a a bat and fight crime cant be taken complet serious burton made a surreal world for batman and batman return creat a perfect environ for hi film but with nolan all i think of is just a crime drama with batman in it the joker could have been just a psycho with makeup the pace is also a flaw sometim the film move too quickli for u to digest what go on and other time it goe to slow that we lose interest onli reason peopl love it wa for heath ledger amaz perform and hi unfortun pas away befor the film releas and even that doesnt fit the bill for a batman movi to sum up the dark knight will go down in histori a the most overr film ever made,Negative
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'.",batman take on the crime lord with the help of lieuten jim gordon and district attorney harvey dent howev an even bigger evil rise to terror gotham maggi gyllenha is an improv over kati holm a rachel daw aaron eckhart add a good perform a harvey dent in the end thi is heath ledger movi he overpow everybodi hi earli death may have immort him but my opinion isnt inflat hi presenc is electr it help that hi charact is so ridicul crazi hi motiv ha noth to do with power or money which is so mundan he want chao and that is so much more fascin heath ledger make thi movi great and it surpass the seri reboot batman begin,Neutral

"I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.

This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.

I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).

There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.

"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.

As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.

The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.

Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.

As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN!

"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.

This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.

Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.

The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.

There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.

No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come.

"Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received.",heath ledger a the joker is brilliant and anytim he on the screen thi action film seem elev it also get the nihilist insan of the charact right a alfr michael cain so correctli put it some men just want to watch the world burn i wa less of a fan of christian bale perform a batman with hi toneless gruff voic and if im honest even the concept of the dark knight with batman san robin view a an evil vigilant by the citizen of gotham i also thought the film tri to pack too much in with the love interesttriangl maggi gyllenha rise of two face aaron eckhart and extran charact eg morgan freeman it could have also use a breather in between all the action scene though some of the element like that batpod with the extra fat tire were pretti cool it goe on way too long at minut and if it had been pare down and more focus on the joker sadist psycholog cruelti could have been a masterpiec all in all it a good entertain film but not worthi of the extraordinari high prais and rate it receiv,Positive
"In my opinion, this movie a bit over-hyped and a bit over-rated actually. Is this movie better than 12 Angry Men or Schindler's List or The Return Of The King? Absoulutely not. Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted. This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger.

"There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.

A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!

The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?

Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.

The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.

Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.

Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!

Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.

As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!",there is just one thing that differenti a legend from ordinari man it hi fight with inner demon to over come all hi fear that defin a legend and thi is what batman stand for batman is not just anoth comic charact but it a complet saga of how you stand tall in spite of lose everyth walk fearlessli even when you are lone and how you fight back against all odd and over shadow your own fear fear the most domin emot mankind ha ever wit batman is no except he still ha fear he still get scare of lose those who are close to him and he is still in doubt when it come to decis but what is interest and inspir about batman is that he ha the abil to use wise the biggest and most danger weapon of all time perfectli brain that whi he is my favourit comic charact and thi time batman is put everyth on the line to save the world from out of control freak the joker a spell bound perform by heath ledger a the joker though he is no more with u but hi immort act a joker is an oscar win perform and will alway be rememb your heart come out to mouth to see the horror joker creat in start i wa bit confus a hi perform remind me of jack nicholson from the first batman movi but later i realis that thi is for real he did not imit jack but showcas the true and horribl side of a real joker the best part about heath is that he display the flip side of a joker fearless there are mani time when we feel that some one could have done better with certain role but not here here heath is perfect a a joker and from now on i will call him heath joker ledger the stori is about a terror that ha shaken the underworld of gotham the fear of batman is get in to crimin mind and all of them are now think where their money can be save from batman reach and that where the joker come with a plan to these crimin kill batman now with hi pervert mind the joker is behind batman life and what follow is a scari hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith v courag at one end joker ha no fear and on the other batman ha a respons of save gotham now the import question is that who will win and more than that at what cost apart from break box offic record thi movi is also abl to break the pattern of film make batman seri is an action seri when you make an action movi you give the requir pace in a movi by focus on elabor the action scene but here the director build the movi with a mix of action a well a other emot scene step by step movi give it audienc action and emot at the time when it requir but with an unexpect style dark intens and a complet batman style the batman movi are famou for it back ground music and the dark knight is no except special when there is sound of a whistl in background of some intens scene in the movi i felt a rush in to my blood and boil my brain my eye pop out while watch those scene to mention batman grill session with the joker is a masterpiec the scene wa simpli awesom mainli coz of background music harvey dent charact could have been better post he becom face i wa expect hi charact to be more involv and longer in the seri rachel daw is also a veri strong influenc charact in the movi her involv in the movi is much focus than kati holm in batman begin but the point im make here is the glam factor in thi movi she wa not given that much footag in a glamor way nevertheless the plot did not allow audienc to think that way either action scene in thi movi are well thought of and will chill the audienc spinal chord my favourit is the chase scene where joker is tri best to catch harvey dent and how batman come in between thi is where batman say asta la vista and welcom hi new girl friend hi damn new bike it call batpod i can imagin how excit you will be when you know that batman is now go to catch the joker and joker is happi that batman ha miss hi shot thi is sheer delight to watch the creativ involv of special effect blend with brilliant cinematographi unlik other hollywood flick the dark knight is a lengthi movi of more than ½ hr of nonstop adrenalin but you wont mind spend that much time watch it mani time we feel that some movi couldv been shorter and some lengthier but with the dark knight that not the case it mainli becaus the movi end up at the time when it is requir to scroll the curtain down i wa so satisfi while come out from the movi hall perfect end well the dark knight is just a begin now im expect the penguin and the riddler to come in to the pictur and take thi battl ahead a i said earlier im a big fan of batman and after thi movi im mad about not just batman but each and everi part of hi movi music and the joker now while im rush straight to the nearest movi store to buy all origin movi and soundtrack of batman seri you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the joker or batman choic is your,Positive

"Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.

Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.

I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.

This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.

Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.

I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.

Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice. In two and a half hours ""The Dark Knight"" makes up for all the silly, offensive garbage adapted from comic books and graphic novels, and reveals just how much can be done with the characters and ideas in those books. This is finally a film that does justice to the Batman universe.",card hardi har har on the tabl go into the dark knight in imax i did not think christoph nolan wa a great director i wa not too taken by batman begin although it wa refresh after burton and schumach remind me of the lesser batman comic i have read and bizarr for noncomedi of the s televis seri and the film version of that except less fun i did not think heath ledger wa among the great actor of hi gener i did not think christian bale wa the best actor aliv and i wa not expect anyth more than an entertain batman movi despit be reassur by everyon i trust about movi that it wa much more have seen it a intend with the scene film specif for imax intact and cover the entir imax screen vertic i can safe say that the dark knight is without question the first time the batman charact and the mani great comic base in gotham citi have been done justic on film nolan version of batman is not meant to be realist it is meant to be plausibl and everyth here includ twofac feel plausibl still the film ha not forsaken it comic book root thi is not the watereddown batman of the s thi is the batman conceiv in the s and reborn in the s moment here thank to ledger astonishingli creepi and believ perform a the joker thi is the origin joker bank robber with no motiv massmurder with not a hint of merci not the ludicr clown jack nicholson horribl portray in burton effort recal the great batman book arkham asylum other recal the kill joke a anyon who ha read those book will testifi that is just about the highest prais i can give the portray of the joker here i do think that see thi in imax enhanc the experi although it is a littl annoy when the pictur clariti goe from a clear a possibl to clearli blownup when the scene switch from those shot on imax camera to those shot on regular film one can realli appreci the sound design here a well which is absolut remark all the way through thi is a far a im concern easili nolan best work a director hi handl of the film pace is absolut stun and the action here is both film and edit much better than in begin it is nolan work with actor that particularli impress with just about everi moment of act be superb here of cours michael cain and morgan freeman are phone it in but they dont exactli need to be brilliant here bale a well display littl depth a wayn but embodi all hi charm and make for an excel batman unless your percept of batman is a wisecrack fool then you might be disappoint no the act i refer to here is the extraordinari perform by ledger oldman and eckhart although ledger will sure get all the attent and he certainli great here i think that both oldman and eckhart stole the show a bit eckhart is better a dent than twofac but the transform is certainli not an easi task for ani actor maggi gyllenha is unquestion better a rachel daw than kati holm wa and nestor carbonel not an actor with much rang is realli veri good a the mayor of gotham citi over and over again film version of batman have disappoint ha the dark knight final got it right no doubt some will moan and complain about it not be distinct or styliz enough not captur the spirit of the comic guess what you have been read the wrong comic the best batman comic may not alway strive for plausibl but they are certainli far from the silli fun some might expect from the dark knight what you will get here is a ten dramat crime thriller with some breathtak action setpiec remark character the joker be given such a complex psycholog profil is a stun achiev and ledger is terrifi in the role you realli believ that he is danger and hi sick social experi are nervewrack to wit i have one or two misgiv about the dark knight i dont know if i would have handl rachel daw and harvey denttwofac the way the nolan brother do in thi screenplay but virtual the rest of the film is pitchperfect the pace is astonish i could hardli believ the film wa a long a it actual wa the act is phenomen the visual look of the film is right especi given the subtext nolan is go for here which youll see when youv seen the film the charact are rich the drama is real the action is spectacular and final the joker is given a definit portray tim burton onc said anyon who know me know i would never read a comic book for shame mr burton mayb if you had you could have made someth thi good the dark knight doe the charact of batman justic it doe the joker justic and it doe the great batman comic justic in two and a half hour the dark knight make up for all the silli offens garbag adapt from comic book and graphic novel and reveal just how much can be done with the charact and idea in those book thi is final a film that doe justic to the batman univers,Positive
"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all.",it is odd to spend more than two hour watch a film and it slowli dawn on you that you are not particularli bother how it end and if anyth rather wish it would end sooner rather than later the dark knight is that kind of film exactli whi i lost interest or even when im not too sure but lose interest i did thi is christoph nolan second stab at batman a well a christian rant bale and although all the element are there it is simpli not a good natur thi be anoth slug blast and punchfest tho despit it reput for be dark thank not a bloodfest mani mani viewer have laud thi a a masterpiec the best movi of so far far surpass begin no it isnt and no it doesnt all i can say is that these peopl have not seen mani masterpiec or mani film in the dark knight in that way which hollywood ha made it sugari own attempt to flatter the audienc by includ a moral dilemma and it doe so not onc but rather often thi time we are invit the we be the popcornchew saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxuri to reflect on moral ambigu and how rel rather than absolut the notion of good and evil can be and each time thi viewer sigh a littl a the say goe you can put lipstick on a pig but it is still a pig we get ani number of high falutin speech about hero and villain but in truth is just so much codswallop in truth thi film is just anoth blockbust and at that it is not even a good a mani other blockbust if you want to medit on the realiti of good and evil of hero and villain by all mean make a film do so but in the dark knight it is all for thi viewer at least all veri phoney apart from that thi film is a tad confus there are too mani charact the plot or at least what there is of it realli doe not bear repeat the suspens is curious unexcit and too often the film drag the old actor are there and all with the veri honour except of the late heath ledger seem to be act by number thi wa i think ledger last film and hi earli death is sad undoubtedli he wa veri talent and have said all that there is not much more to say it not bad it not particularli good a part of the seri it stand tall but then the seri is not all that outstand see it if you want to and if after read thi you decid not to well sorri but you wont be miss much at all,Neutral

"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil. Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down. To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas. It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in.

"When Batman Begins was released in the year 2005, I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series, that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny, playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of Batman..

So when I went to watch this movie, I was ready to see the Heath Ledger's Joker cracking some jokes, blowing up lots of places, killing tons of people, going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..

Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work..

Other actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully.

This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, For those of you who haven't watched it yet, I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely..",when batman begin wa releas in the year i watch it and wonder see the end scene where the joker wa reveal to be the villain in the next instal of the seri that well how christoph nolan is gonna incorpor the funni play and complet insan charact of the joker in to hi dark and seriou version of batman so when i went to watch thi movi i wa readi to see the heath ledger joker crack some joke blow up lot of place kill ton of peopl go way beyond insan and of cours laugh a lot but the joker i saw wa rather just the opposit he did blow up build he did kill peopl he did go insan and laugh but he did all of thi with a motiv and a touch of control and calm to it it been a while sinc i have seen a movi where the villain shine more than the hero and in thi movi heath ledger joker complet stole the show everyth he doe seem reason and the thing that he say feel honest and true the movi grip you throughout it min runtim christoph nolan nail it and show how comic book charact can be taken out of their color world put in a dark and seriou movi and make it work other actor also play their part well christian bale wa good a batmanbruc wayn aaron eckhart wa brilliant a harvey dent gari oldman maggi gyllenha michael cain and morgan freeman play their role beauti thi movi is one of my favorit movi of all time for those of you who havent watch it yet i recommend you watch it a soon a possibl becaus thi kind of gem come rare,Positive

"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it.

But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.

Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it.

"A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling.

It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time.

Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic.

The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.

Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.

An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.

Superior to pretty much everything else.

"The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.

The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: ""I'm not wearing hockey pads!"" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed.

The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname ""the Dark Knight"" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.

It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the﻿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.

The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes.

"The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.

The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much ""face time"" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.

Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right.",the dark knight wa probabl the best action film ive ever seen not onli is the design tone special fx sound and music all were excel but the script wa den complex and thorough the perform from the actor were all veri good particularli ledger who took the joker into a realm of sociopath that weve not seen in a batman charact befor thi may be ledger best perform from hi all too short career the onli issu i have is the extrem gross and gori of the twofac make upspeci fx i think it goe a bit too far to have littl bit of flesh dangl from hi visibl bone structur the onli thing i believ that wa better from the previou bat man seri but the director doesnt use too much face time on that charact so the look remain shock and not overdon certainli the dark knight will stand out for quit some time a the best comic book movi a it ha that a it root howev it may also stand a a masterpiec in it own right,Neutral
"The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him, but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film; the camera-work was excellent, the pace was gripping, the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid. Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree.

All in all, a perfect film and magnificent acting...the film should have been named after the joker...Batman himself was not needed....such a Batman film will never again be produced, due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger.

"I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.

The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.

Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.

I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.

If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now.

You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it.

"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.

*Runs*

The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.

Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?

We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?

Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.

Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.

Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven.",i have the flame suit on ive alreadi call my lawyer ive prepar fake passport and bought sever differ alias to run by i have also transfer my fund to a european account whi so seriou becaus here we go the dark knight is not the epic piec of godli art that everyon is hype it to be run the dark knight is a good piec of work a decent movi but doe not fall into nearperfect by ani mean despit the amaz perform write and action sequenc the heart and core of the comic book flavor is sever miss issu from batman begin is carri over and repeat here even though they arent a easi to spot thi is much better than begin but still fail to total era the memori of burton vision of batman resembl more the godfath and heat rather than a flick like iron man or spiderman it a total differ sort of movi involv superhero and supervillian gotham citi still doesnt truli look like gotham citi start the movi is a bank robberi unlik ani other set the tone of the movi instantli we see the joker heath ledger stir some earli troubl with the mob and crime lord we then see batman imit lurk about last but not least we see bruce wayn ex maggi gyllenha around the arm of anoth man harvey dent aaron eckhart then run amok throughout the minut of the dark knight are action sequenc plot twist sever surpris sever close call and a whole lot of crime drama good v evil is a battl that is horrif blur and human natur surround gotham citi is be test all the tension is overcom bruce wayn and batman and he begin question hi motiv and placement within the citi the write staff threw in plenti of deep and engag dialogu amongst all the action we see onscreen it a batman fan dream come true or is it we can start by credit heath ledger for a fine perform a the joker but if ledger deserv an oscar for hi role so should nicholson back in becaus believ there are mani similar in term of perform the joker here is cynic merciless and is bent on anarchi for no reasonbut so wa joker in if ledger win the oscar then jack himself should be accept it on hi behalf christian bale yet again fail a batman with hi frustrat raspi voic a bruce wayn he nail it but a batman he still need a bit of work when batman start monolog it hard not to cring the rest of the cast doe a good job most notabl gari oldman a lt gordon let also not forget morgan freedman michael cain aaron eckhart and maggi gyllenha the biggest strength of the batman univers lie within the balanc of batman and hi villain almost all of them have some sort of connect with our hero howev the treatment of villain yet again is disappoint a we see a few villain limit to mere cameo and the joker himself despit the trailer doe not get a much screen time a you may assum in the infam version we saw the joker rise from lowli punk crimin to a seriou threat to the entir citi in the dark knight unlik batman there is liter no explan a to whi he is the way he is there is no backstori reveal noth that could possibl explain hi physic appear and mental state sure he may craft some tale but whi believ a madman tale a he wield a knife to your lip dark knight best moment were not the action sequenc but the immens tension and suspens predat the payoff rare could you predict the outcom of some of the conflict and for the most part all the payoff were grand sometim lead to applaus the chase and actionpack moment themselv were also wellcraft and made great use of special effect yet with so mani problem fli at you at the same time it imposs to expect them all to be conclud and wrap up in the end nolan direct is stun from time to time but then he run out of steam toward the end of the third act when the movi is almost finish the end albeit unexpect wa a bit underwhelm and quit vagu especi consid the fact that the dark knight is minut long bottom line the neg is sprinkl about in thi review but dont let that fool you the dark knight is inde a great blockbust flick that will have you forget that there popcorn and soda by your side from the dazzl perform of the late heath ledger to the carefullyconstruct action sequenc that keep the pace flow there is plenti to prais about that be said it still not the best superhero movi of alltim batman is a comic book and the cast of thi new franchis must rememb thi you can dwell a much realism a youd like but the fact remain that thi isnt a realist franchis nor should it ever be treat a such gotham citi is still miss it gritti gothic dark architectur and style of burton film and need more emphasi on the villain that are in batman world the villain are the yang to the batman mytholog and batman himself is the yin you cant have too much of one and not enough of the other while it isnt batman and robin or fantast four both of them the dark knight still fall short of masterpiec qualiti simpli becaus of it exchang of comic book style for realist crime drama the dark knight is a great ride but not an epic one to qualiti heaven,Positive
"Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: ""If you only see one movie this summer, this is it"". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.

I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.

Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.

So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again.",rememb those say that magazin or critic would say one of the more popular one wa if you onli see one movi thi summer thi is it well until now i never understood that too well but now i realli realli do the dark knight is that movi a plain a i can say it the dark knight is by far the greatest most entertain movi releas all year period i had the privileg of see an advanc show for manag onli in imax about a week befor thi movi releas i wa ecstat that not onli wa i see thi much anticip movi a week earli but it wa my first imax experi if you have the option definit go with imax it wa unbeliev realli it felt like you were fli thru gotham citi about to fall into anoth scheme by the joker but enough about imax how about the movi well batman begin receiv exemplari rate from critic about an out of on imdb if i recal correctli a well sinc batman begin turn out so well and end with batman receiv word of the joker everi fan wa readi for thi movi asap just a short quick year later we final got the dark knight the main attract for thi show wa heath ledger part after hi sudden death some will be say that thi wa one of hi best perform and i can agre strongli the joker wa thrill yet comic heath brought out the dark villain even though he is well a joker all hi phrase and say made the movi what it wa but it still kept your mindset in fright mode veri hard to tackl look back on everi scene notic it wa hour and some odd minut i can not find a scene unnecessari few movi bare the except of be insan long but not at all bore and thi one fit that perfectli veri long veri detail but with patron pay that imax ticket price you want everi minut you can get i also could not find ani flaw realli with the movi except for the cast of maggi gyllenha anyon but kati holm wouldnt be good enough i mean maggi is pretti but not nearli a good look a kati holm sort of ruin her charact for me she is veri talent though absolut so after all wa said and done thi movi to me wa just about perfect out of christoph nolan absolut took batman to a new level and said forget the rest thi is top notch i want to watch it again,Neutral

"Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman).

This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.

A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨, ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part.

"The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot.

Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him.

My inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.

The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going.

As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be.",the dark knight is an intens power dramat and compel film but despit that im not sure i realli enjoy it a great deal i saw it on the huge imax screen in london which ha an abil to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film but at the same time variou aspect of the film meant that i felt alien from the charact and the plot who is batman and what do we realli know about him after have watch the whole film all hour of it im not sure i could say what are hi motiv doe he realli love rachel inde doe he have the capac to love at all again hint are given but the central charact is so poorli develop that it make it hard to realli care about what happen to him or those around him my inabl to empathis with the charact wasnt help by the ridicul number of subplot most of which are rush or incomplet and the relentless pace at which the film move from one to the other the film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storylin and develop the charact and theme within that the frenzi sequenc of larg unrel action setpiec whilst initi breathtak end up feel dull and predict what wa lack in between the explos wa anyth resembl meaning dialogu a few mumbl word from batman and some inan muse from the joker werent enough to keep the film go a such i left the film feel somewhat exhaust at the bleak joyless violent world i had wit and disappoint that thi muchhyp film just hadnt been a good a i wa hope it would be,Negative

"I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.

The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.

The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.

The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.

And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.

There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.

Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",i grew up on the anim seri love the first two batman film sort of like batman forev but disappoint in batman and robin i have yet to rewatch batman begin but i thoroughli enjoy thi film on rewatch have realli like it first time it is veri well made and grip with some great perform but person i would put casablanca wizard of oz amadeu and it a wonder life over thi the film doe suffer from be a littl too talki and the plot on occas can be hard to follow due to a lot go on nevertheless it is extrem good and not onli one of the better batman movi but also one of the better superhero movi visual and technic the film cannot be fault the cinematographi is superb and the spectacl of gotham citi is dazzl christoph nolan direct is taut and ensur that the action is explos the plot is a littl bloat with the joker bent on destroy organis crime for good and make batman cross between hero and vigilant and subplot about harvey dent and rachel daw and hong kong but there are some truli effect scene that are tightli structur and the screenplay in gener while a littl too talki in the first twenti minut is intellig and sophist the joker especi ha some veri sinist line that stay with you for a long while afterward the music by none other than maestro han zimmer who also compos music for the lion king gladiat and the pirat of the caribbean movi is outstand rous beauti haunt it is definit memor and doesnt becom forgett or gener like the music in the hurt locker for exampl and i have to say the sound engin here is phenomen particularli on veri high volum the explos sound veri authent a if they are come from outsid rather than from in the film and i have to mention the act a that wa terrif christian bale manag to be dark brood and charismat like batman should be though if i did have a complaint he doe speak in a veri hoar voic a if he got a sore throat and i somehow did not know what to make of it it wasnt irrit or anyth justodd anyway aaron eckhart is terrif a harvey denttwofac even if hi storylin wa a tad too rush and maggi gyllenha is veri sensit and care a rachel morgan freeman doe well in a smaller role a doe the excel gari oldman and michael cain is perfect a the loyal butler alfr there is no doubt in my mind that heath ledger gave the best perform of the film he wasnt just brilliant he wa phenomen unpredict insan extrem sinist and corrupt not to mention chillingli psychot i am torn on who i prefer over jack nicolson or heath ledger it is a veri close call i admit i am more familiar with nicolson portray and like hi mix of the scari and comic and even tragic joker but the joker here in the dark knight is truli sinist and even more of a threat to batman and in my opinion thi joker ha line that linger longer into the memori overal not absolut perfect but it is extrem good thank to primarili ledger perform and the dazzl visual spectacl bethani cox,Positive

"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight* is not just a superhero film; it is a gripping crime drama that transcends its genre to deliver a profound narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the human condition.

The film masterfully balances action with deep character development, showcasing Batman's struggle against not only external threats but also his internal demons. The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, particularly Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, which redefines the archetype of the villain. Ledger's Joker is chilling and chaotic, serving as the perfect foil to Batman's quest for justice.

Nolan's direction is taut, crafting a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The screenplay is sharp, blending intense action sequences with thought-provoking dialogue that raises significant ethical questions about the nature of heroism versus vigilantism.

The cinematography and score further elevate the film, with the haunting themes underscoring the emotional weight of the story. Each frame is meticulously crafted, contributing to an immersive experience that draws audiences into Gotham's dark underbelly.

Overall, *The Dark Knight* is a landmark in filmmaking that demands to be experienced. It is not only a thrilling ride filled with unforgettable moments but also a poignant exploration of the dichotomy between order and chaos, making it a film that resonates long after the credits roll. A true triumph in cinematic storytelling.",christoph nolan the dark knight is not just a superhero film it is a grip crime drama that transcend it genr to deliv a profound narr that explor theme of moral chao and the human condit the film master balanc action with deep charact develop showcas batman struggl against not onli extern threat but also hi intern demon the perform are noth short of extraordinari particularli heath ledger icon portray of the joker which redefin the archetyp of the villain ledger joker is chill and chaotic serv a the perfect foil to batman quest for justic nolan direct is taut craft a suspens atmospher that keep viewer on the edg of their seat the screenplay is sharp blend intens action sequenc with thoughtprovok dialogu that rais signific ethic question about the natur of heroism versu vigilant the cinematographi and score further elev the film with the haunt theme underscor the emot weight of the stori each frame is meticul craft contribut to an immers experi that draw audienc into gotham dark underbelli overal the dark knight is a landmark in filmmak that demand to be experienc it is not onli a thrill ride fill with unforgett moment but also a poignant explor of the dichotomi between order and chao make it a film that reson long after the credit roll a true triumph in cinemat storytel,Positive

"When I watched the dark knight for the first time, I was about 16 and I had mixed feelings towards it, I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer. Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after 'watching and having few knowledge' about some critically acclaimed films like ""the departed"", "" Inception "" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre .It was a game changer for my taste in films. It still tops the superhero genre even after 14 years of it's release. The only superhero/comic book film which comes close to this one is ""Logan"" in my opinion. So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of it's exploration towards many themes like human nature, dark reality of society, nature of lies, true and false characteristics and many more. Considering other parameters like cinematography, background score and screenplay, I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolan's films. So I end my review here, thanks for reading.

Easily one of the best comic book films ever made. Bale isn't great as Bruce/Bat but his acting is on par. However Heath's joker isn't an Oscar legend for no reason. One of the best portrayals of a character of l time. Up there with James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano.,easili one of the best comic book film ever made bale isnt great a brucebat but hi act is on par howev heath joker isnt an oscar legend for no reason one of the best portray of a charact of l time up there with jame gandolfini a toni soprano,Neutral
"""The Dark Knight"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic success that transcends the superhero genre, leaving a lasting mark on the world of film. Nolan masterfully weaves a complex and morally ambiguous take of chaos and order, exploring the thin line between heroism and villainy. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is legendary! He is a force of nature and added layers of depth to the character. Heath Ledger steals every scene with a magnetic presence that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. Christopher Nolan's vision, coupled with Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance makes it an instant modern classic.",the dark knight isnt just a movi it a cinemat success that transcend the superhero genr leav a last mark on the world of film nolan master weav a complex and moral ambigu take of chao and order explor the thin line between heroism and villaini heath ledger portray of the joker is legendari he is a forc of natur and ad layer of depth to the charact heath ledger steal everi scene with a magnet presenc that is both terrifi and mesmer christoph nolan vision coupl with heath ledger unforgett perform make it an instant modern classic,Neutral

"Quite simply ""Dark Knight"" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a ""proper"" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).

Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't ""just"" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of ""dark"" and of perception of ""society."" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.

Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these ""abilities"" about him which are soooo unrealistic.

So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.

The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!

I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!

Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.

It's cool It's original It's awesome

I can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be.

"Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.

""The Dark Knight"" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from ""Prison Break"", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but ""sometimes the truth is not good enough"". My vote is nine.

"Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from cliché, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good.",write thi review at the tail end of open weekend the dark knight ha broken the record for open weekend and deservedli so thi film is a stepabov the standard summer blockbust howev the film also sit atop imdb top film of alltim list a rank that wont last nearli a long a it boxoffic rank line have been long to see thi film and mani of those who are vote on thi open weekend are diehard who wait in line and were readi to love thi film regardless of what it offer of cours the fact that thi film stand alon in it genr in term of write cinematographi art design and plot help boost it rate into the stratospher but when the non diehard begin to watch and vote well see thi film settl into it right place somewher in the top of all time it one of those few film that is entertain and access enough to plea the same peopl who went out in drove for spiderman while artist and smart enough to plea the more discern cinemat audienc truli disturb the charact were far from cliché a one would expect from the genr no charact is allgood or allbad ledger joker come close but earn a touch of sympathi none of the hero are flawless which is a sign of ani good film my singl complaint besid the variou hardtobeliev fall batman surviv is the rate thi film is fartoo disturb to garner a pg rate and deal with the ugliest side of human in a way that should probabl be accompani by a good convers that can add some perspect yet anoth reason whi thi film is so good,Negative
