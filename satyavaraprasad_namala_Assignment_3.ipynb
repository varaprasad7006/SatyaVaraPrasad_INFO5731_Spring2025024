I had heard various opinions praising the performances, the scenery, the soundtrack... However, I never got to see it, until today. And, after seeing it, I can affirm that it is a contender to be one of the best films in history. There is no criticizable point. Heath Ledger's performance is one of the best performances ever given on the big screen, and even the secondary characters shine. The city has a tone of horror, suffering and fear, just as someone would imagine Gotham, and all this thanks to the excellent setting that this feature film presents, both in terms of the scenery and the music, composed by the famous Hans Zimmer. Last but not least is the plot, and I can firmly say that it is one of the best I have ever heard in my life. I still can't assimilate how well the Joker's plans are made, worthy of a crazy but charismatic and cunning villain.\\n\\nIn conclusion: 10/10.\",\n          \"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.\\n\\nThis is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.\\n\\nChristopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.\\n\\nThe acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.\\n\\nThere is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.\\n\\nNo spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money.

or not the brilliant storytel is there so is the breathtak cinematographi and of cours the superb direct from nolan it doesnt matter if your a fan of batman or superhero film in gener for thi movi it after all consid to be one of the best film of it decad and one of the greatest and most influenti film of all time the film receiv eight nomin at the oscar win the award for best sound edit and best support actor for ledger perform a the joker in the film wa select for preserv in the unit state nation film registri by the librari of congress for be cultur histor or aesthet signific becom the second superhero film after s superman to earn the honor when the menac known a the joker wreak havoc and chao on the peopl of gotham batman must accept one of the greatest psycholog and physic test of hi abil to fight injustic christian bale portray bruce wayn and batman do both the physic part a batman and the dramat part of bruce wayn give each hi all and ultim give u one of the best live action portray of the dark knight there is so mani thing bale doe right and i love hi take on the icon cape crusad but there are peopl who have some critic toward him and that complet fine though he wasnt perfect in batman begin bale have truli grown into the role and with hi method act he doesnt let the audienc or himself down bale take on the charact is perfect for nolan the dark knight trilog heath ledger play the joker and he took method act to the extrem earn himself mani award along with an oscar the great and memor perform doesnt stop with bale and ledger theyr join by talent actor like michael cain a alfr pennyworth gari oldman a jame gordon aaron eckhart a harvey dent maggi gyllenha a rachel daw and morgan freeman a luciu fox along with a support cast they captur the comic book version of the charact and success bring qualiti and fantast perform to the film mani are extrem memor like gari oldman and aaron eckhart theyr simpli award worthi michael cain deserv a lot of prais for hi role a alfr hi portray is my favorit of all live action portray you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself becom the villain that a quot anyon will recogn the write is spectacular from the charact to dialogu to world build the screenplay are simpli impress and fantast in so mani way the screenplay is written by christoph nolan and jonathan nolan but the stori wa cowritten by david s goyer i just cant prais the writer enough there variou of theme in the film most are matur and ill just say it now it a dark movi but done perfectli some theme are the triumph of evil over good justic versu corrupt the thin line between anarchi and order and the terribl logic of human natur honestli the film could easili be look at a a black and white stori with batman be the good and joker the bad but christoph nolan take the stori in a grey area that make you question thing especi those theme i just wrote down and he succe perfectli batman the dark knight is full of beauti craft and just terrif set piec done by how they kept everyth ground with practic effect instead of reli on cgi some sequenc that just show how great look film it is for an exampl the bank heist which wa shot entir in imax and it look fantast from start to finish with it music score and incred direct and cinematographi other sequenc worth mention are the action sequenc when nolan liter flip a truck over i dont want to spoil anyth so ill stop there but there so mani brilliant and memor action sequenc in thi film what nolan succeed in do is to keep the tension and suspens go and the tempo never slow down walli pfister and christoph nolan is to thank for the stun set piec the cinematograph and director walli pfister actual got nomin for an oscar for hi work in thi film an award he wa worthi of win with the dark knight trilog thing were to be a ground and realist a possibl which i thank christoph nolan for it show in the visual effect the set and especi the sound edit overal an incred experi from start to finish with everi scene thought out with foreshadow and symbol the dark knight doe it extrem well experienc thi trilog for the first time in k start with batman begin and now the dark knight i just have to say it brilliant and the right way to watch the film the hdr is perfect and truli captur the cinemat pictur nolan want for these releas make it the closest to a theatric view the soundtrack is superb the music and everyth are truli phenomen han zimmer work with jame newton howard in creat the uniqu and power music score a truli mesmer one it still a mind blow experi to watch after all these time and a film ill continu to rewatch if not for the beauti cinematographi and direct it the act and character but also it action sequenc and top notch visual effect there so much to enjoy in thi film from the hero to it villain and everyth in between the dark knight is what the return of the king is to lord of the ring a masterpiec\n",

I had heard various opinions praising the performances, the scenery, the soundtrack... However, I never got to see it, until today. And, after seeing it, I can affirm that it is a contender to be one of the best films in history. There is no criticizable point. Heath Ledger's performance is one of the best performances ever given on the big screen, and even the secondary characters shine. The city has a tone of horror, suffering and fear, just as someone would imagine Gotham, and all this thanks to the excellent setting that this feature film presents, both in terms of the scenery and the music, composed by the famous Hans Zimmer. Last but not least is the plot, and I can firmly say that it is one of the best I have ever heard in my life. I still can't assimilate how well the Joker's plans are made, worthy of a crazy but charismatic and cunning villain.\\n\\nIn conclusion: 10/10.\",\n          \"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.\\n\\nThis is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.\\n\\nChristopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.\\n\\nThe acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.\\n\\nThere is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.\\n\\nNo spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!\",\n          \"This film is not the masterpiece that IMDb seems to assign it as.

I had heard various opinions praising the performances, the scenery, the soundtrack... However, I never got to see it, until today. And, after seeing it, I can affirm that it is a contender to be one of the best films in history. There is no criticizable point. Heath Ledger's performance is one of the best performances ever given on the big screen, and even the secondary characters shine. The city has a tone of horror, suffering and fear, just as someone would imagine Gotham, and all this thanks to the excellent setting that this feature film presents, both in terms of the scenery and the music, composed by the famous Hans Zimmer. Last but not least is the plot, and I can firmly say that it is one of the best I have ever heard in my life. I still can't assimilate how well the Joker's plans are made, worthy of a crazy but charismatic and cunning villain.\\n\\nIn conclusion: 10/10.\",\n          \"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.\\n\\nThis is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.\\n\\nChristopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.\\n\\nThe acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.\\n\\nThere is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.\\n\\nNo spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money.
